## What is it?

We developed a **Rare Disease Research Collaborative Network (RCN)** to connect rare disease (RD) researchers 
who co-authored on RD related publications, co-investigated on NIH funded RD projects, co-directed on RD based clinical trials.

## Data Collection and Sources

- **Researchers data** was collected from publications, NIH funded projects, and Clinical Trials data related to Rare Diseases (RD) using [RDAS](https://rdas.ncats.nih.gov/).
- Data on affiliations and locations of researchers were mapped to FIPS codes using the [uscities.csv](https://github.com/Jaber-Valinejad/RDAS/blob/master/RDAS_Social_Network/Data/uscities.csv) file.
- To accelerate mapping researcher affiliations in NIH funded projects to FIPS codes, we utilized the [Grant_org1.csv](https://github.com/Jaber-Valinejad/RDAS/blob/master/RDAS_Social_Network/Data/Grant_org1.csv) file.
