This condition also causes the body to absorb too much iron, which builds up and can damage tissues and organs. In particular, iron overload can lead to an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia), congestive heart failure, diabetes, and chronic liver disease (cirrhosis). Rarely, people with CDA type II have mediastinal tumors. CDA type II usually results from genetic changes in the SEC23B gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."

Depending on how many genes are lost and how many normal cells a person has, additional features or birth defects may also be present. Ring chromosome 13 typically is not inherited, occurring sporadically during the formation of egg or sperm cells or shortly after the egg and sperm join together. In some cases, Ring chromosome 13 is inherited from a parent. Chromosome testing of parents can help determine whether the ring chromosome was inherited and whether future children have an increased chance to have a chromosome abnormality."

This means that both genetic and environmental factors may interact to cause a person to develop the disease. The extent to which genes play a role is unclear, but familial cases have been described. Certain medications, such as NSAIDS and proton pump inhibitors, have been reported to cause or trigger the disease in some people.

Some people develop abnormal enlargement of the thyroid gland (goiter). Women with Graves' disease may have irregular menstrual periods. In some cases, Graves' disease causes other problems such as Graves' dermopathy (a condition marked by red, swollen skin), various eye abnormalities (such as bulging eyes, vision problems, pain, or swelling), emotional or behavioral changes, heart-related complications, or bone problems (such as osteoporosis)."

Other symptoms may include weakness, headaches, or a burning, tingling or prickling sensation in the skin. Some people have episodes of severe pain, redness, and swelling (especially in the hands and feet). Essential thrombocythemia may be caused by a person acquiring (not inheriting) a somatic genetic change in any of several genes, such as the JAK2 gene (most frequently), CALR gene, and rarely, the MPL, THPO, or TET2 gene.

The lesions typically begin small and then become larger, and they may bleed or ulcerate before becoming scaly and crusty. They often develop a red-brown color. Symptoms associated with lesions may include itching and/or pain, which may be debilitating. The frequency of eruptions varies over time and from person to person. Lesions may be very persistent, or they may go away for long periods of time before coming back. They may occur anywhere on the body, but they typically develop on the trunk, arms, and legs, and may develop on the hands, face, and genitalia. They generally go away on their own over a period of weeks to months (usually between 3 and 8 weeks), with or without scarring. LyP is not contagious. The cause of LyP is not known, but there is no evidence that it is hereditary. Stress is often reported to trigger eruptions of lesions. A diagnosis of LyP requires evaluating the symptoms and having a skin biopsy for various types of laboratory tests. While LyP usually is not classified as a cancer (although there has been some debate), it has characteristics of lymphoma under the microscope, and people with LyP have a life-long increased risk of developing lymphoma such as mycosis fungoides, PC-ALCL, or Hodgkin lymphoma.

Proteus syndrome is caused by a change in the AKT1 gene. It is not inherited, but occurs as a random genetic change in a body cell in a developing baby (fetus) early in pregnancy. The AKT1 genetic change affects only a portion of the body cells. This is why only a portion of the body is affected and why individuals with Proteus syndrome can be very differently affected."

These skin abnormalities are generally found on the face, neck, arms, or hands. Gastrointestinal Anthrax is caused by eating undercooked meat from an infected animal. Signs and symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, loss of appetite, fever, and a sore throat. Pulmonary (lung) Anthrax occurs when Anthrax spores are inhaled. It is the most serious form of the condition. Early signs include flu-like symptoms, shortness of breath, nausea, and coughing up blood. As the condition advances, affected people may develop high fever, difficulty breathing, shock, and meningitis. Injection Anthrax is spread by injecting illegal drugs. Signs and symptoms of this form of Anthrax include redness and swelling at the sight of the infection. The condition may progress to shock, multiple organ failure and meningitis."

Typical attacks may strike up to eight times a day and are relatively short-lived. On average, a cluster period lasts 6 to 12 weeks. Autonomic symptoms may include: conjunctival injection (bloodshot eyes), swelling under or around the eye, excessive tearing of the eyes, drooping of the eyelid, runny nose and/or nasal congestion, and forehead and facial sweating. These symptoms generally occur only during the pain attack and are on the same side as the headache pain. Males are more commonly affected than females."

Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, which means that each human cell contains 46 chromosomes. Each chromosome has a p and q arm; p is the short arm and q is the long arm. The p arm is always on the top and the q arm is on the bottom. An inversion occurs when there are two breaks in one chromosome. The segment between the breakpoints flips around and reinserts back into the chromosome. Genetic material may of may not be lost as a result of the chromosome breaks. If both breaks occur in the same arm of the chromosome, this is called a paracentric inversion. If one break occurs in the short arm and the other in the long arm of the chromosome, then this is called a pericentric inversion.

NRH often does not cause signs or symptoms (so is likely underdiagnosed), but in some people, it leads to a type of portal hypertension called non-cirrhotic portal hypertension (NCPH). NCPH refers to abnormally high blood pressure in the portal vein (the vein that carries blood from the intestine to the liver) that is not caused by cirrhosis (scarring of liver tissue that impairs its function). NCPH typically is less severe than portal hypertension caused by cirrhosis. Symptoms of portal hypertension may include fatigue, edema, itching, jaundice, and abdominal discomfort or swelling due to fluid build-up (ascites). Complications that may develop include bleeding esophageal varices and an enlarged and overactive spleen (hypersplenism). Liver function in most people with NRH remains normal (even in those who develop NCPH), and liver failure in people with NRH and NCPH is rare. The cause of NRH is not well-understood.

NRH often does not cause signs or symptoms (so is likely underdiagnosed), but in some people, it leads to a type of portal hypertension called non-cirrhotic portal hypertension (NCPH). NCPH refers to abnormally high blood pressure in the portal vein (the vein that carries blood from the intestine to the liver) that is not caused by cirrhosis (scarring of liver tissue that impairs its function). NCPH typically is less severe than portal hypertension caused by cirrhosis. Symptoms of portal hypertension may include fatigue, edema, itching, jaundice, and abdominal discomfort or swelling due to fluid build-up (ascites). Complications that may develop include bleeding esophageal varices and an enlarged and overactive spleen (hypersplenism).

FHM is currently classified into 4 subtypes, distinguished by their genetic cause: FHM type 1 (the most common type) is caused by genetic changes in the CACNA1A gene and is commonly associated with cerebellar degeneration. FHM type 2 is caused by genetic changes in the ATP1A2 gene and may be associated with seizures. FHM type 3 is caused by genetic changes in the SCN1A gene. FHM type 4 is diagnosed if no genetic change currently known to cause FHM can be identified. Inheritance of FHM is autosomal dominant, but not everyone who inherits a genetic change responsible for FHM will have symptoms (a phenomenon called reduced penetrance). The diagnosis of FHM requires that at least one first- or second-degree relative has also been diagnosed with hemiplegic migraine. Tests such as a CT scan or MRI of the brain, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and EEG may be needed to rule out other potential causes of headache and neurological symptoms. Genetic testing may confirm the subtype of FHM in a family.",GARD,"Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) is an inherited form of hemiplegic migraine.

These episodes are hard to predict and can disrupt quality of life. They can require frequent or lengthy hospitalizations and can be fatal. People with type 1 diabetes are at greatest risk. While many people with type 1 diabetes experience hypoglycemia, only a small proportion of people with type 1 diabetes experience the frequent blood glucose swings described as 'brittle.' People with long-standing type 2 diabetes may also have difficulty controlling blood glucose, but few have these frequent swings. People of any age with diabetes can be affected with these frequent ups and downs in blood glucose levels. Some research suggests that women may be affected more often than men. Frequent episodes of hypoglycemia can lead to hypoglycemic unawareness and make the condition worse. Keeping diabetes under good control for at least several weeks can restore hypoglycemic awareness. New technologies such as continuous glucose monitors and insulin pumps may help improve control. In diabetes, many factors can trigger frequent changes in blood glucose levels.

SE describes a state in which a person has one prolonged seizure, or a cluster of seizures without recovery time in between. The symptoms of NORSE typically begin with a mild fever and general symptoms of illness. People with NORSE may also experience behavioral and cognitive symptoms. SE associated with NORSE can last days, weeks, or months and may lead to a comatose state. A likely cause is identified in about half of all people with NORSE. The most common causes of NORSE include autoimmune disorders, paraneoplastic disorders, and viral encephalitis. Studies indicate that changes in certain genes, including the SCN2A and IL1RN gene(s) may increase the risk to develop NORSE. When the cause cannot be found, cryptogenic NORSE is diagnosed. Most people with cryptogenic NORSE experience a fever prior to seizure development. These cases are classified as a sub-type of NORSE, called Febrile Infection-Related Epilepsy Syndrome (FIRES). A diagnosis of NORSE is suspected in people who develop SE that does not respond to typical treatment and that does not have an obvious cause.

Some children with an SCN2A related disorder do not fit directly into one of these major forms. Most children with SCN2A genetic changes will have seizures that start in the first few weeks of life. Other symptoms of an SCN2A related disorder may include feeding or gastrointestinal problems, developmental delay, movement disorders, and/or poor muscle tone (hypotonia). SCN2A genetic changes may be inherited from a parent or may occur for the first time in a child with an SCN2A related disorder (a de novo genetic change)."
