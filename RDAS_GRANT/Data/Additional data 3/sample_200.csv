"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
PROJECT 1 – WEE1 inhibition in uterine serous carcinomas or p53-mutated uterine cancers
Uterine serous carcinomas (USC) are a distinct histologic subtype of uterine cancer with poor prognosis,
comprising up to 40% of uterine cancer deaths. Similarly, data from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
has shown that p53-mutated uterine cancers are often “serous-like” and have decreased overall survival
compared to other subtypes of uterine cancer. Therapeutic options for this group of patients are limited; in the
recurrent setting, chemotherapy has limited activity and few effective therapies have been identified beyond
the recently FDA-approved regimen of combination pembrolizumab and lenvatinib. Molecularly, these cancers
are characterized by features that suggest the frequent presence of concomitant cell cycle dysregulation
(alterations in TP53, CCNE1, RB1) and high oncogene-driven replication stress (alterations in MYC,
KRAS/NRAS, ERBB2), which might make these cancers particularly vulnerable to targeting replication stress
via WEE1 inhibition. A previous clinical trial of the WEE1 adavosertib in USC at our institution demonstrated
significant clinical activity with a response rate of 29.4%, although targeted next generation sequencing did not
reveal any correlation between specific molecular alterations and clinical activity. The overall objectives of this
project are to (a) assess the correlation between anti-tumor activity of WEE1-targeting agents with functional
and IHC measures of replication stress, (b) explore how IHC measures of replication stress correlate with the
activity of WEE1 inhibition in PDX and GEMM models of p53-mutated endometrial cancers and clinical
samples, and (c) evaluate the correlation of functional and IHC measures of replication stress with clinical
activity of WEE1 inhibition in uterine serous cancer in a biopsy-driven trial. We hypothesize that sensitivity of
p53-mutated uterine cancers is correlated with levels of replication stress and/or the effect of WEE1 inhibition
on replication stress. To test this hypothesis, we will investigate in vitro the effect of WEE1 inhibition on
replication fork dynamics in established endometrial cancer PDO models and the correlation between
functional and IHC measures of replication stress with sensitivity to WEE1 inhibition in these PDOs. We will
further investigate how IHC measures of DNA damage or RS, including γH2AX, pRPA, pKAP1, or pCHK1,
change in vivo after exposure to WEE1 inhibition and whether these measures correlate with in vivo activity
across a panel of established endometrial cancer PDX and GEMMs. Finally, we will assess the correlation of
functional and IHC measures of RS with clinical activity in a biomarker study of the WEE1 inhibitor Zn-c3 in
USC through the establishment of co-clinical PDO models from trial biopsy samples. The findings from these
studies will provide important mechanistic insight into how RS underlies sensitivity to WEE1 inhibition and can
also further inform the development of this novel therapeutic target and potential future biomarker development
for targeting WEE1 in USC and p53-mutated uterine cancers. These findings may also provide insight into
extension of WEE1 inhibition as a strategy in other cancer types.",Targeting WEE1 in uterine serous or p53-mutated uterine cancer,"PROJECT NARRATIVE: PROJECT 1 – WEE1 inhibition in uterine serous carcinomas or p53-mutated
uterine cancers
Molecular features of uterine serous carcinoma (USC) and other p53-mutated uterine cancers, a group of uterine
cancers with poor prognoses, suggest that these cancers have high “replication stress”, a state where replication
of the DNA is slowed and under stress, and may therefore be particularly vulnerable to drugs that target
replication stress like a WEE1 inhibitor. A clinical trial with the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib previously
demonstrated significant clinical activity in USCs. In this project, we seek to advance the care and improve
outcomes for individuals with USC or p53-mutated uterine cancers by establishing a better understanding of the
mechanisms of replication stress and how replication stress is linked to WEE1 inhibitor sensitivity, leveraging
assays of replication stress and WEE1 inhibitor sensitivity in patient-derived organoid model systems,
immunohistochemical measures of DNA damage and replication stress in mouse model systems, and biopsy
samples taken from patients on a clinical trial with the WEE1 inhibitor ZN-c3.",https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10769256,Accounting;Area;Ascites;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biological Models;Biopsy;Biopsy Specimen;CCNE1 gene;Cancer Patient;Carcinoma;Cell Cycle;Cessation of life;Clinical;Clinical Sensitivity;Clinical Trials;DNA Damage;DNA biosynthesis;DNA replication fork;Data;Development;Dose;Drug Targeting;ERBB2 gene;Endometrial Carcinoma;Exposure to;FDA approved;Future;Gamma-H2AX;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genomics;Histologic;In Vitro;Individual;Institution;KRAS2 gene;Letters;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Microfluidics;Modeling;Molecular;Mutate;Mutation;Oncogenes;Oncogenic;Organoids;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacologic Substance;Phase;Prognosis;Progression-Free Survivals;RB1 gene;Recurrence;Regimen;Sampling;Serous;Specimen;Speed;Stable Disease;Stress;TP53 gene;Testing;The Cancer Genome Atlas;Therapeutic;Translating;Uterine Cancer;Uterus;arm;biomarker development;cancer surgery;cancer type;care outcomes;chemotherapy;effective therapy;improved outcome;in vitro Model;in vivo;in vivo Model;inhibitor;insight;investigator-initiated trial;mouse model;new therapeutic target;next generation sequencing;novel;patient derived xenograft model;pembrolizumab;pre-clinical;replication stress;response;targeted agent;tumor,10769256,1P01CA269021-01A1,,,,,,,,"['accounting', 'area', 'ascites', 'biological assay', 'biological markers', 'biological models', 'biopsy', 'biopsy specimen', 'ccne1 gene', 'cancer patient', 'carcinoma', 'cell cycle', 'cessation of life', 'clinical', 'clinical sensitivity', 'clinical trials', 'dna damage', 'dna biosynthesis', 'dna replication fork', 'data', 'development', 'dose', 'drug targeting', 'erbb2 gene', 'endometrial carcinoma', 'exposure to', 'fda approved', 'future', 'gamma-h2ax', 'genetically engineered mouse', 'genomics', 'histologic', 'in vitro', 'individual', 'institution', 'kras2 gene', 'letters', 'link', 'malignant neoplasms', 'measures', 'microfluidics', 'modeling', 'molecular', 'mutate', 'mutation', 'oncogenes', 'oncogenic', 'organoids', 'patients', 'pharmaceutical preparations', 'pharmacologic substance', 'phase', 'prognosis', 'progression-free survivals', 'rb1 gene', 'recurrence', 'regimen', 'sampling', 'serous', 'specimen', 'speed', 'stable disease', 'stress', 'tp53 gene', 'testing', 'the cancer genome atlas', 'therapeutic', 'translating', 'uterine cancer', 'uterus', 'arm', 'biomarker development', 'cancer surgery', 'cancer type', 'care outcomes', 'chemotherapy', 'effective therapy', 'improved outcome', 'in vitro model', 'in vivo', 'in vivo model', 'inhibitor', 'insight', 'investigator-initiated trial', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'patient derived xenograft model', 'pembrolizumab', 'pre-clinical', 'replication stress', 'response', 'targeted agent', 'tumor']",,
"SUMMARY - PROJECT 1
The goal of this Center is to understand how gene expression and associated gene function within key neuronal
subtypes regulates the neurobiological substrates required to form cortical circuits that enable decision-making
and behavioral adaptations (i.e., behavioral circuits). Fitting with this theme, Project 1 will investigate the biology
of synaptic GEFs and GAPs at the molecular/biochemical and cellular levels. GEFs and GAPs are complex
multidomain proteins with multiple splice variants. Their protein domains perform enzymatic catalysis, subcellular
targeting, and autoregulation. Such domain combinatorial complexity can further specialize function to various
subcellular compartments, neuronal subtypes, and developmental time-points. Project 1 will test the hypothesis
that a structure-function analyses of isoforms, domains, and clinical variants will reveal mechanisms of
protein regulation that underlie neuronal morphogenesis, synapse formation, and synapse plasticity. We
recently developed novel high- and medium-throughput assays to characterize the modulation of GEF/GAP
catalytic activity and neuronal function by single nucleotide variants and chemical probes. Using these, we
will delineate GEF and GAP spatiotemporal complexity by dissecting the roles of splice variants, enzymatic
domains, and non-catalytic domains at the molecular and cellular levels. Additionally, Project 1 will develop
chemical probes which will be utilized to further define their biological function in Projects 2-4. Spatiotemporal
and GTPase activity analyses will identify critical periods and cell/tissue specificity for biological activity and
genetic and pharmacological manipulation to inform Projects 2–4. Mutation-driven structure-function analysis
will reveal mechanistic insight to guide iPSC and mouse studies in Projects 2–4. Chemical probes will be
highly valuable in Projects 2–4 and for the field. Data generated will reveal novel mechanism of function and
regulation to provide a conceptual framework for the large family of > 180 Ras/Rho GEF/GAPs, with broad
implications.",Structural determinants and pharmacological modulation of synaptic GEFs and GAPs,,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10862385,Amino Acids;Attention;Behavioral;Binding;Biochemical;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Process;Biology;Catalysis;Catalytic Domain;Cells;Cellular biology;Chemicals;Clinical;Complex;Data;Decision Making;Development;Family;Family member;Feedback;Gene Expression;Genes;Genetic;Goals;Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases;Homeostasis;Human;In Vitro;Individual;Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons;Mental disorders;Molecular;Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins;Morphogenesis;Mus;Mutation;Neurobiology;Neurons;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmaceutical Chemistry;Protein Analysis;Protein Isoforms;Proteins;RNA Splicing;Regulation;Reporting;Role;SYNGAP1;Safety;Signal Transduction;Single Nucleotide Polymorphism;Specificity;Structure;Substrate Specificity;Synapses;Tertiary Protein Structure;Testing;Time;Tissues;Toxic effect;Variant;analog;combinatorial;critical period;drug candidate;gene function;genetic analysis;in vitro activity;in vivo;induced pluripotent stem cell;inhibitor;insight;mouse model;neural;neural circuit;neuroregulation;novel;paralogous gene;pharmacologic;protein function;rho;small molecule;spatiotemporal;structural determinants;subcellular targeting;synaptogenesis;synergism;tool,10862385,1P50MH132775-01A1,,,,,,,,"['amino acids', 'attention', 'behavioral', 'binding', 'biochemical', 'biological', 'biological assay', 'biological process', 'biology', 'catalysis', 'catalytic domain', 'cells', 'cellular biology', 'chemicals', 'clinical', 'complex', 'data', 'decision making', 'development', 'family', 'family member', 'feedback', 'gene expression', 'genes', 'genetic', 'goals', 'guanosine triphosphate phosphohydrolases', 'homeostasis', 'human', 'in vitro', 'individual', 'induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons', 'mental disorders', 'molecular', 'monomeric gtp-binding proteins', 'morphogenesis', 'mus', 'mutation', 'neurobiology', 'neurons', 'pathway interactions', 'patients', 'pharmaceutical chemistry', 'protein analysis', 'protein isoforms', 'proteins', 'rna splicing', 'regulation', 'reporting', 'role', 'syngap1', 'safety', 'signal transduction', 'single nucleotide polymorphism', 'specificity', 'structure', 'substrate specificity', 'synapses', 'tertiary protein structure', 'testing', 'time', 'tissues', 'toxic effect', 'variant', 'analog', 'combinatorial', 'critical period', 'drug candidate', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'in vitro activity', 'in vivo', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitor', 'insight', 'mouse model', 'neural', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'paralogous gene', 'pharmacologic', 'protein function', 'rho', 'small molecule', 'spatiotemporal', 'structural determinants', 'subcellular targeting', 'synaptogenesis', 'synergism', 'tool']",,
"PROJECT SUMMARY
The thematic focus of this Center is to understand how a signaling hub of molecules that regulate small GTPases
contribute to the precise developmental formation and maturation of inter-connectivity between neuronal
components of cortical microcircuits. The Center will address this goal with interrelated projects that will provide
an in-depth examination of the function of Trio and SynGAP; two potent regulators of GTPase signaling in the
developing brain. Multiple signaling molecules are involved in the organization and refinement of cortical
microcircuits that are required for correct information processing in the cortex. Trio and Syngap1 are known to
regulate synaptic connections but how they contribute to precise arrangements of cortical microcircuits through
neuronal migration, synaptic morphogenesis and refinement of connections during development is not known.
Pathogenic variants in these genes are causally linked to neurodevelopmental disorders that, while characterized
by heterogeneous genetic etiology, have shared symptoms. Convergence in symptoms suggests that disorders
with diverse molecular causes can be understood by defining the pathophysiological consequences on the
synapses and circuits that underlie the disrupted behaviors. In Project 3, we will address the broader goals of
The Center by analyzing the roles of these complex signaling molecules in the formation and refinement of
cortical microcircuits. Using ex vivo functional electrophysiological and optogenetic mapping approaches we will
dissect the effect of disrupted Trio and SynGAP signaling on cortical architecture. The project will assess (1) the
spatial cell-type and temporal functions of Trio and SynGAP, (2) the importance of enzymatic and non-enzymatic
functional domains to their roles in cortical connectivity, and (3) the action of novel small molecule inhibitors of
these GTPase regulators in synaptic function and connectivity at acute and chronic timescales. These studies
will transform our understanding of how Trio and SynGAP function in developing cortical circuits and along with
collaborative and integrated efforts in the Center will create a foundational understanding of their roles in
neurodevelopment.",Mechanisms underlying cortical local circuit regulation by synaptic GEFs and GAPs,,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10862387,ARHGEF5 gene;Acute;Adolescent;Affect;Alternative Splicing;Architecture;Behavior;Behavioral;Birth;Brain;Bromodeoxyuridine;Chronic;Complex;Decision Making;Development;Disease;Electrophysiology (science);Gene Expression;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Goals;Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases;Interneurons;Investigation;Knock-in Mouse;Knowledge;Label;Link;Maps;Measurement;Measures;Modeling;Molecular;Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins;Morphogenesis;Mus;Mutant Strains Mice;Nature;Neocortex;Neurobiology;Neurodevelopmental Disorder;Neurons;Pathogenicity;Pathway interactions;Phenotype;Physiological;Play;Point Mutation;Production;Proteins;Radial;Regulation;Role;SYNGAP1;Sensory;Series;Shapes;Signal Transduction;Signaling Molecule;Slice;Somatosensory Cortex;Spliced Genes;Symptoms;Synapses;Synaptic Transmission;Testing;Variant;causal variant;cell type;critical period;gene function;hippocampal pyramidal neuron;in vivo;information processing;innovation;insight;loss of function;migration;mouse model;neocortical;nerve stem cell;neural circuit;neurodevelopment;neuron component;novel;optogenetics;pharmacologic;postnatal development;protein function;small molecule;small molecule inhibitor;synaptic function;synergism,10862387,1P50MH132775-01A1,,,,,,,,"['arhgef5 gene', 'acute', 'adolescent', 'affect', 'alternative splicing', 'architecture', 'behavior', 'behavioral', 'birth', 'brain', 'bromodeoxyuridine', 'chronic', 'complex', 'decision making', 'development', 'disease', 'electrophysiology (science)', 'gene expression', 'genes', 'genetic', 'genetic predisposition to disease', 'goals', 'guanosine triphosphate phosphohydrolases', 'interneurons', 'investigation', 'knock-in mouse', 'knowledge', 'label', 'link', 'maps', 'measurement', 'measures', 'modeling', 'molecular', 'monomeric gtp-binding proteins', 'morphogenesis', 'mus', 'mutant strains mice', 'nature', 'neocortex', 'neurobiology', 'neurodevelopmental disorder', 'neurons', 'pathogenicity', 'pathway interactions', 'phenotype', 'physiological', 'play', 'point mutation', 'production', 'proteins', 'radial', 'regulation', 'role', 'syngap1', 'sensory', 'series', 'shapes', 'signal transduction', 'signaling molecule', 'slice', 'somatosensory cortex', 'spliced genes', 'symptoms', 'synapses', 'synaptic transmission', 'testing', 'variant', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'critical period', 'gene function', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'migration', 'mouse model', 'neocortical', 'nerve stem cell', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuron component', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'pharmacologic', 'postnatal development', 'protein function', 'small molecule', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'synaptic function', 'synergism']",,

"Project Summary
Replication stress (RS) is defined as the slowing or stalling of the replication fork progression during DNA
synthesis and is widely recognized as a significant cause of genomic instability and a critical feature of cancer
cells. The response to RS is facilitated by ATR kinase which induces a cascade of molecular events to facilitate
cell cycle arrest, stabilization of the replication forks and DNA repair. Inhibition of ATR may be an effective
strategy against tumors with high degree of RS. However, thus far, clinical evaluation of ATR inhibitors (ATRi)
has demonstrated limited efficacy as monotherapy outside the setting of BRCA deficient and ATM deficient
tumors. Using two high-throughput approaches, i.e., PRISM screening of ~800 genomically characterized
human cancer cell-line models and genome-wide CRISPR-based functional screen of ATRi elimusertib, we
found that inhibition of the PI3K pathway may synergize with ATRi. Preliminarily, we have also demonstrated
synergism between PI3K inhibitor copanlisib and ATRi elimusertib in vitro and in vivo. Clinically, this synergism
is particularly relevant to uterine cancer (UC) because of the prevalence of genomic alterations associated with
high RS in uterine serous tumors (e.g. CCNE1 amplification, MYC amplification, FBXW7 mutations) and because
UC (predominantly those with endometrioid or clear cell histology) frequently harbor ARID1A mutations which
have been shown to be associated with cell cycle progression defects in both S and G2/M phases of the cell
cycle leading to increased RS and sensitivity to ATR inhibition. Additionally, although all histologic subtypes of
UC are characterized by PI3K pathway alterations, response to PI3K inhibition as monotherapy has been
disappointingly low and no PI3K inhibitor is currently approved in UC. For all these reasons, we hypothesize that
combined ATR and PI3K pathway inhibition may be an effective therapeutic strategy to capitalize on concomitant
PI3K pathway alterations and high degree of RS in uterine serous and ARID1A-mutated uterine tumors. In Aim
1, we will perform in vitro studies of targeted inhibition of ATR alone and in combination with PI3K inhibition
across a collection of established patient-derived organoids with various genomic backgrounds to assess for
synergism and elucidate its underlying mechanisms. In Aim 2, we will evaluate in vivo synergism between ATRi
elimusertib and PI3Ki copanlisib in PDX and GEMM models of UC and will explore whether this correlates with
IHC assays of replication stress. Finally, in Aim 3, we will conduct a Phase 1b dose escalation trial of PI3K
inhibitor copanlisib and ATR inhibitor elimusertib in UC with two dose expansion cohorts in uterine serous (cohort
A) and ARID1A mutated uterine tumors (cohort B). It is our expectation that the research proposed herein, if
successful, will provide patients with recurrent UC with a new therapeutic option that is applicable across different
histologic subtypes of UC for which no specific therapies exist. Furthermore, if successful, the therapeutic
strategy of exploiting RS and PI3K pathway alterations using combined ATR/PI3K blockade would be readily
applicable to alternative tumor types such as breast, ovarian and prostate cancers as well as cancers with
ARID1A deficiency whose therapy remains a significant unmet medical need.",Combined ATR and P13k inhibition in uterine cancer,"Project Narrative
Genomic alterations associated with high replication stress (RS) and concomitant PI3K pathway alterations are
prevalent in uterine serous and ARID1A-mutated uterine cancers (UC). Based on preliminary data supporting

therapeutic potential and biologic activity of this novel therapeutic strategy in UC, whose incidence and death

CORE 3 – PRECLINICAL MODELING
The Preclinical Modeling Core will be co-led by Dr. Joyce Liu, a medical oncologist specializing in gynecologic
cancers who has experience in the development of gyn patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and patient-derived
organoid (PDO) models, and Dr. Jean Zhao, who is an expert in the development of genetically engineered

replication stress in uterine cancers, including (1) targeting WEE1 in uterine serous carcinomas or p53-mutated
uterine cancers; (2) combined ATR inhibition and PI3K inhibition in uterine cancers; and (3) induction of
replication stress to generate anti-tumor immunity in uterine cancers through the activation of the cGAS/STING
pathway. The Core will generate, characterize, and maintain preclinical models in support of each of the
projects, and will provide expertise in the design of modeling experiments. The goal of Aim 1 of the Preclinical
Modeling Core is to generate, maintain, and characterize additional PDX models of endometrial cancer from
patient samples. Successfully implanted models will then be passaged and fully characterized; in collaboration
with the Pathology Core, histologic fidelity to the primary tumor will be assessed. Additionally, models will be
assessed for genomic fidelity to the parent tumor via next generation sequencing. In Aim 2 of the Core, we will
continue to generate, maintain, and characterize PDO models of endometrial cancer from patient samples.
Successful organoids will also be characterized for fidelity to the parent tumor, similar to in Aim 1. Finally, Aim
3 of the Core will focus on the generation, maintenance, and characterization of a collection of endometrial
cancer GEMMs, with defined genomic characteristics selected based upon their frequent presence and clinical
relevance to human endometrial cancer. The collection of fully characterized PDXs, PDOs, and GEMMs

CORE 3 – PRECLINICAL MODELING
Certain endometrial cancers have molecular characteristics that suggest the presence of high replication stress

valuable insights into the biology, mechanism, and potential efficacy of therapeutic strategies and combinations.
The Preclinical Modeling Core will generate, maintain, and characterize a collection of patient-derived xenograft
(PDX) models, patient-derived organoid (PDO) cultures, and genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of

"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Pathology Core will be co-led by Dr. Marisa Nucci, a pathologist with expertise in gynecologic neoplasia,
and by Dr. Geoffrey Shapiro, who brings experience with biomarker development for DNA repair inhibitor-based
preclinical and clinical work. The core will provide support for all of the projects, focused on targeting replication
stress and DNA damage response in women with advanced endometrial cancer, including (1) WEE1 inhibition
in uterine serous or TP53-mutant uterine cancers; (2) combined ATR/PI3K inhibition in uterine cancers; and (3)
induction of replication stress to activate the cGAS/STING pathway to generate anti-tumor immunity in uterine
cancers. The Core will ensure quality control of data generated from human and mouse tissues in each of the
projects and carry out unbiased analyses of results utilizing proper controls. The goal of Aim 1 is to provide
histologic assessment and confirmation of experimental models via the application of standard criteria for
endometrial cancer diagnosis, along with immunohistochemical analyses to confirm Mullerian origin and
histologic subtype in both parental tumors and in organoid or patient-derived xenograft models generated from
those tumors. Models will be assessed serially to ensure that they retain fidelity to the primary tumors from
which they were derived. The primary objective of Aim 2 is to analyze immunohistochemical biomarkers of DNA
damage (g-H2AX, pKAP1), replication stress (pRPA, pKAP1), ATM deficiency, oncogene activation (cyclin E,
MYC) and homologous recombination repair proficiency (RAD51 foci). The characterization of models and
tumors pre- and on-treatment with the WEE1 inhibitors adavosertib and ZN-c3 or with a combination of the PI3K
inhibitor copanlisib and the ATR inhibitor elimusertib will determine if these biomarkers are predictive of response
and will confirm target engagement by these agents. In Aim 3, models and primary tumors subjected to WEE1
and ATR inhibitor-based treatments will be interrogated for changes in the immune microenvironment using a
validated multiple immunofluorescence platform that will quantify T-cell infiltrates and subtypes along with
immune checkpoint protein expression. Changes in the immune microenvironment will be correlated with DNA
damage and replication stress biomarkers, activation of the cGAS/STING pathway and with clinical outcomes.",Pathology Core,"PROJECT NARRATIVE
Endometrial cancers carry genomic features of replication stress and endogenous DNA damage that may make
them susceptible to treatments that induce further replication stress above a lethal threshold. Projects in this
proposal will study WEE1 and ATR inhibitor-based treatments in organoid and mouse models, and in clinical
trials. The Pathology Core will offer histologic quality control for model development, conduct
immunohistochemistry for predictive and pharmacodynamic markers related to DNA damage, replication stress
and DNA repair, and oversee multiplex immunofluorescence for interrogation of the immune microenvironment,
in order to identify subsets of patients likely to benefit from these treatments and to determine if response is
related to the activation of innate immunity. The Core will bring expertise in Gynecologic Pathology and DNA

"ABSTRACT – CORE B
Synaptic GEF and GAPs have emerged as significant players in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs).
While a large number of clinical variants have been reported in these genes in patients with NDDs, their
molecular and cellular consequences have not been systematically analyzed. The precise biological
functions of synaptic GEF and GAP in human neuronal subtypes remain unclear, while there are no chemical
tool compounds that can acutely manipulate their catalytic activity. Recent advances in the generation and
differentiation of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer new opportunities for
elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms of NDDs. Certain unique capabilities of iPSC technologies are well
suited for the study of NDDs, including providing a platform for examining the effects of genetic approaches
or chemical probes on human neuron activity, morphology, and developmental processes, and enabling
investigations of distinct human neuronal subtypes. Our Center proposes to study genetic variants in human
synaptic GEF and GAP genes and their associated phenotypes in human iPSC-derived neurons. The
overarching goal of Core B is to provide high quality, efficient and cost-effective services to Center members
related to iPSC technologies. Core B will have an exclusive focus on the neurobiology of NDDs. Core B will
align with the goals of Projects 1 and 2 to interrogate NDD-relevant cellular and network phenotypes. All
data and cell lines generated by the Neurodevelopmental Stem Cell Core will be shared with the members
of our Center and the broader academic community. The specific aims of the Neurobiology Stem Cell Core
(Core B) are: 1) To generate, perform QC, expand and maintain high-quality iPSC lines. 2) To perform

"CORE C PROJECT SUMMARY
The principal goal of this Center is to understand how gene expression and associated function within key
neuronal subtypes regulates neurobiological substrates required to form cortical circuits that enable
decision-making and behavioral adaptations. Ras and Rho-like small GTPases play fundamental biological
roles within neurons by controlling cell-autonomous growth-related signaling pathways and orchestrating
neuronal circuit assembly. Consistent with the biological importance of GTPase signaling in brain
development and function, several prominent neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) risk genes are upstream
regulators of neuronal small GTPase signaling. We will focus on the neurobiology of two major genetic
regulators of GTPase signaling, TRIO, a top 10 risk factor for schizophrenia, and SYNGAP1, a top 10 risk
factor for ASD and intellectual disability. TRIO/SYNGAP1 are molecular effectors that orchestrate neuronal
migration, neuronal morphogenesis, synaptic connectivity, synaptic plasticity, in vivo neural circuit function,
and associated behavioral adaptations. However, it is currently unknown how their expression and function
within specific neuronal subtypes and defined developmental time windows refine cortical circuits to impact
cognitive processing and associated behaviors. Our interdisciplinary, multi-institutional “Center for GTPase
Regulation of Neuronal Cell Biology and Behavior” will study the contributions of TRIO/SYNGAP1 in cortical
circuit assembly at cellular, synapse, circuit, systems, and behavioral levels in complementary model
systems, including mouse models and human iPSC-derived neurons. The Mouse Resource Core will
facilitate studies using mouse models. Mouse somatosensory cortex shares similar overall architecture and
approximates human molecular pathways, neuronal function, and circuit organization. Thus, mouse models
are a valuable system for studying cortical development at the level of neurons, synapses, circuits and
systems, as well as for evaluating potential therapeutic strategies. The mouse genome is a tractable system
for engineering mutations in orthologous genes to enable study of genetic variants in the context of brain
tissue. Conditional deletion strategies allow for dissection of cell-type specific effects underlying synapse
and circuit dysfunction. Combining genetic manipulation with electrophysiologic and optogenetic tools,
allows for detailed, multilevel mechanistic studies in the context of an intact cortex, our Center will address
gaps in knowledge about the contribution of small GTPase regulators to cortical circuit assembly. The
primary objectives of the Mouse Resource Core are to provide centralized support of mouse model needs
for the Center Projects, including generation of novel knock-in mouse lines; maintenance and specialized
breeding of genetically modified mice; and facilitating sharing of mouse lines with the academic community.

"Project Summary
Microsatellite stable (MSS)/mismatch repair proficient (MMRP) uterine cancers (UCs) represent approximately
two thirds (66%) of all UCs in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The combination of pembrolizumab with
lenvatinib is currently the only FDA approved treatment for recurrent MSS/MMRP UCs, but adverse effects are
a major challenge in the clinic and a large population of patients do not respond to this regimen. There are
currently no FDA approved and no effective salvage therapies for patients with recurrent MSS/MMRP UC who
do not tolerate, do not respond or progress through pembrolizumab/lenvatinib. Notably, MSS/MMRP UCs are
characterized by genomic alterations associated with high degree of replication stress (RS); therefore, use of
DNA damage checkpoint kinase inhibitors such as WEE1 or ATR inhibitor can be therapeutically exploited to
induce tumor-selective synthetic lethality and modulate anti-tumor immunity, representing an appealing strategy
against these tumors. Furthermore, in our preliminary work, we have demonstrated that targeting the RS with
ATR or WEE1 in UCs leads to activation of the STING/TBK1/IRF3 pathway. Thus, we hypothesize that DNA
damage checkpoint kinase inhibitors will increase RS-associated DNA damage to engage DNA sensing STING
pathway activation to prime the immunologically “cold” MSS/MMRP UCs into “hot” tumors; combined DNA
damage targeting agents with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can overcome tumor-associated
immunosuppression and lead to effective antitumor activity against MSS/MMRP UCs. We propose to test an
entirely novel strategy to extend the benefit of immunotherapy in MSS/MMRP UC by using DNA damage
checkpoint kinase inhibitors in combination with ICIs in both human and murine models of UC. In Aim 1, we
propose to characterize the immune effects of ATR and WEE1 inhibitors on human UC cell lines, patient-derived
organoid models and tumor specimens from the clinical trials of adavosertib and BAY1895344/copanlisib from
Projects 1 and 2 respectively. In Aim 2, we will assess the contribution of RS-targeting potentiated DNA sensing
STING pathway activation to the immune effect and therapeutic efficacy of WEE1 or ATR inhibition in vivo in
syngeneic models of UC, and in Aim 3, we will evaluate the anti-tumor immunity and therapeutic efficacy of
WEE1i or ATRi in combination with ICI in vivo in syngeneic models of UC. The overarching goal of this project
is to provide the mechanistic insights and important information to support initiation of clinical trials of effective
combinations DNA damage checkpoint inhibitors with ICI in patients with MSS/MMRP UC.",Targeting replication stress to engage DNA sensing STING pathway derived anti-tumor immunity to improve the therapeutic outcomes in uterine cancer,"Project Narrative
While the combined pembrolizumab and lenvatinib has been an approved treatment for recurrent MSS/MMRP
uterine cancers (UCs), adverse effects are a major challenge in the clinic and many patients do not respond to
this regimen. Given that most MSS/MMRP UCs are associated with high degree of replication stress (RS), we
hypothesize that DNA damage checkpoint kinase inhibitors (e.g. ATRi and WEE1i) will increase RS-associated
DNA damage to not only induce tumor cells’ synthetic lethality but also engage DNA sensing STING pathway
activation to enhance anti-tumor immunity to improve the therapeutic outcome for UCs. The main goal of the
project it to investigate integration of DNA damage checkpoint kinase inhibition and immune checkpoint inhibition

connectivity, neural function); 2) how specific protein domains in Trio and SynGAP regulate circuit substrates;
and 3) how small molecule targeting of GEF/GAP domains regulate circuit substrates. We will test the
hypotheses that gene dosage, functional domains, catalytic activity, and genetic variants in Trio and SynGAP
affect the ability of human neurons to undergo normal morphogenesis, synaptogenesis, and connectivity. In Aim
1, we will determine the expression and function of Trio and SynGAP in diverse neural subtypes within
developing human neurons and organoids. In Aim 2, we will determine the physiological importance of functional
domains in Trio and SynGAP in human neurons and organoids. Finally in Aim 3, we will determine the effects of
pharmacological inhibition of Trio and SynGAP in human neurons and organoids. These proposed studies will
have a broad, long-lasting impact on the field by determining the physiological importance of individual isoforms
and domains, as well as enzymatic and non-enzymatic functions of Trio and SynGAP in human neurons.
Demonstrating effects of pharmacological modulators of Trio and SynGAP will further yield a valuable toolbox
with which to study other GEF and GAP superfamily members. Findings from Project 2 will provide fundamental
information about the neurobiology of these important regulators of GTPase signaling in the brain.",Biology of synaptic GEFs and GAPs in human neurons,,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10862386,Affect;Alternative Splicing;Axon;Behavior;Behavioral;Biological;Biology;Brain;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cerebrum;Coculture Techniques;Collaborations;Complement;Data;Decision Making;Defect;Dendrites;Development;Exhibits;Gene Dosage;Gene Expression;Genes;Goals;Growth;Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases;Heterozygote;Human;Individual;Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons;Investigation;Knock-out;Link;Loss of Heterozygosity;Modeling;Molecular;Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins;Morphogenesis;Morphology;Mus;Mutant Strains Mice;Mutation;Neurites;Neurobiology;Neurodevelopmental Disorder;Neurons;Neurophysiology - biologic function;Organoids;Pathogenicity;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Phenocopy;Phenotype;Physiological;Process;Prosencephalon;Protein Isoforms;Regulation;Research Personnel;Rodent;SYNGAP1;Signal Transduction;Structure;Synapses;Tertiary Protein Structure;Testing;Time;cell type;excitatory neuron;gene function;genetic variant;hindbrain;in vivo;induced pluripotent stem cell;inhibitor;inhibitory neuron;loss of function mutation;mRNA Expression;member;migration;neural;neural circuit;neuron development;novel;pharmacologic;protein expression;single-cell RNA sequencing;small molecule;spatiotemporal;success;synaptogenesis;synergism,10862386,1P50MH132775-01A1,,,,,,,,"['affect', 'alternative splicing', 'axon', 'behavior', 'behavioral', 'biological', 'biology', 'brain', 'crispr/cas technology', 'cerebrum', 'coculture techniques', 'collaborations', 'complement', 'data', 'decision making', 'defect', 'dendrites', 'development', 'exhibits', 'gene dosage', 'gene expression', 'genes', 'goals', 'growth', 'guanosine triphosphate phosphohydrolases', 'heterozygote', 'human', 'individual', 'induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons', 'investigation', 'knock-out', 'link', 'loss of heterozygosity', 'modeling', 'molecular', 'monomeric gtp-binding proteins', 'morphogenesis', 'morphology', 'mus', 'mutant strains mice', 'mutation', 'neurites', 'neurobiology', 'neurodevelopmental disorder', 'neurons', 'neurophysiology - biologic function', 'organoids', 'pathogenicity', 'pathway interactions', 'pattern', 'phenocopy', 'phenotype', 'physiological', 'process', 'prosencephalon', 'protein isoforms', 'regulation', 'research personnel', 'rodent', 'syngap1', 'signal transduction', 'structure', 'synapses', 'tertiary protein structure', 'testing', 'time', 'cell type', 'excitatory neuron', 'gene function', 'genetic variant', 'hindbrain', 'in vivo', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitor', 'inhibitory neuron', 'loss of function mutation', 'mrna expression', 'member', 'migration', 'neural', 'neural circuit', 'neuron development', 'novel', 'pharmacologic', 'protein expression', 'single-cell rna sequencing', 'small molecule', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'synaptogenesis', 'synergism']",,
"UF Scripps (Project 4) PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this center is to understand how gene expression and function within neuronal subtypes regulates
neurobiological substrates required to form cortical circuits that enable decision-making and behavioral
adaptations. The Center will address this topic through in-depth biological investigations of Trio and Syngap1,
two regulators of GTPase signaling in the brain that are also causally linked to NDDs. A defining feature of the
Center is that these genes will be studied at multiple levels of neural function - molecular, cellular, synaptic,
circuit, behavior. In keeping with the theme of the center, Project 4 will assess the function of these genes at
the highest levels of brain function – how they regulate the functional integration of neuronal subtypes into
circuits required for behavioral adaptations. Project 4 will address the unifying themes in the Center by
measuring neuronal subtype functional circuit integration, circuit plasticity, and behavioral adaptions, by
utilizing three classes of mouse perturbation models that target expression or function of these genes. The first
set of perturbation models will assess how the cell-autonomous expression of each gene -- within unique
neural subtypes and at different periods of development -- impact cortical circuit function and behaviors these
circuits are known to guide. The second set of models will express point mutations within known functional
domains of the proteins encoded by these genes. Finally, the third set of models will include acute and/or
chronic pharmacological manipulations of Trio and Syngap1 GEF/GAP domains. The impact of this research
is that it will highlight, when, where, and how these genes regulate circuit assembly and circuit plasticity
required for transforming sensory signals into decisions that drive behavior.",Regulation of in vivo cortical circuit function and behavior by synaptic GEFs and GAPs,,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10862388,Acute;Alternative Splicing;Behavior;Behavior assessment;Behavioral;Biochemical;Biological;Brain;Cell Physiology;Cells;Chronic;Cognition;Cognitive;Data;Decision Making;Development;Gene Expression;Genes;Genetic;Goals;Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases;Heterozygote;Investigation;Knock-in Mouse;Link;Measures;Modeling;Molecular;Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins;Mus;Neurobiology;Neuronal Plasticity;Neurons;Neurophysiology - biologic function;Neurosciences;Pathway interactions;Perceptual learning;Point Mutation;Property;Proteins;Regulation;Research;SYNGAP1;Sensory;Series;Signal Transduction;Slice;Structure;Synapses;System;TRIO gene;Tertiary Protein Structure;Time;excitatory neuron;gene function;in vivo;inhibitory neuron;insight;mouse model;neural;neural circuit;neurodevelopment;pharmacologic;protein expression;sensory stimulus;small molecule;synergism;two photon microscopy,10862388,1P50MH132775-01A1,,,,,,,,"['acute', 'alternative splicing', 'behavior', 'behavior assessment', 'behavioral', 'biochemical', 'biological', 'brain', 'cell physiology', 'cells', 'chronic', 'cognition', 'cognitive', 'data', 'decision making', 'development', 'gene expression', 'genes', 'genetic', 'goals', 'guanosine triphosphate phosphohydrolases', 'heterozygote', 'investigation', 'knock-in mouse', 'link', 'measures', 'modeling', 'molecular', 'monomeric gtp-binding proteins', 'mus', 'neurobiology', 'neuronal plasticity', 'neurons', 'neurophysiology - biologic function', 'neurosciences', 'pathway interactions', 'perceptual learning', 'point mutation', 'property', 'proteins', 'regulation', 'research', 'syngap1', 'sensory', 'series', 'signal transduction', 'slice', 'structure', 'synapses', 'system', 'trio gene', 'tertiary protein structure', 'time', 'excitatory neuron', 'gene function', 'in vivo', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'mouse model', 'neural', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'pharmacologic', 'protein expression', 'sensory stimulus', 'small molecule', 'synergism', 'two photon microscopy']",,
"Oxylipins comprise a rapidly growing in numbers class of lipid mediators derived from polyunsaturated fatty
acids such as arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid, linoleic
acid, etc. Collectively, oxylipins have been implicated in the regulation of a vast variety of physiological
responses from pain and inflammation to blood clotting and gastric acid secretion. As a result of important
physiological roles played by oxylipin mediators, their metabolic interconversions received an intense scrutiny.
To date, these efforts allowed to identify the main metabolic pathways responsible for the biosynthesis of major
classes of oxylipins. On the other hand, their catabolic interconversions, i.e. subsets of biochemical reactions
which frequently alter their biological activities, still remain rather poorly understood. Recently, we
demonstrated that human microsomal dehydrogenase reductase 9 (DHRS9) exhibits a robust activity oxidizing
hydroxyl groups of many important oxylipins such as pro-inflammatory mediator leukotriene B4 or pro-resolving
mediators such as resolvin D1 and lipoxin A4, for example. These findings strongly suggest that DHRS9
activity can alter the tissue balance between pro-inflammatory and pro-resolving mediators and, thereby, affect
the progression of inflammation as well as the resolution of inflammation. In agreement with this hypothesis,
our preliminary data show that lungs of naïve, untreated DHRS9 deficient mice display all characteristic signs
of inflammation, which are further exacerbated by lipopolysaccharide treatment. Together, these observations
suggest that DHRS9 deficiency promotes lung inflammation and makes the lungs more susceptible to injury.
Thus, experiments outlined in this application have been designed to test our major working hypothesis that
DHRS9 is a highly potent oxylipin dehydrogenase with broad substrate specificity which plays a critically
important role in body’s ability to control inflammation. This hypothesis will be explored through the following
Specific Aims: 1) to elucidate the molecular basis underlying the broad substrate specificity of DHRS9 in order
to define the spectrum of its naturally occurring substrates and 2) to establish the physiological role of DHRS9
in controlling lung inflammation and injury. The results of these studies will define the pathways of oxylipin
metabolism controlled by DHRS9 and will lay the foundation for development of better informed therapeutic
approaches targeting lung inflammation.",Role of DHRS9 in oxylipin metabolism,"Our preliminary data suggest that DHRS9 is a robust, broadly specific oxylipin dehydrogenase, which plays

"PROJECT SUMMARY
The following proposal outlines a 5-year career training plan that will prepare Dr. Alexander Holtz to be an
independent physician-scientist and leader in the field of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) biology and
cellular therapies for pulmonary vascular disorders. Pulmonary vascular diseases, such as pulmonary
hypertension (PH), are devastating illnesses associated with high morbidity and mortality with frustratingly
limited treatment options. Endothelial cell dysfunction is a core mechanistic driver of these disorders, especially
in cases where gene mutations impact endothelial cell biology (FOXF1, BMPR2, etc.). Dr. Holtz’s long-term
vision is to develop autologous endothelial replacement therapies where patient-derived iPSCs are generated,
undergo gene-correction ex vivo, and then are differentiated to endothelial cells (iEndos) to provide a limitless
supply of healthy donor endothelial cells for transplantation without the need for lifelong immunosuppression.
Dr. Holtz presents his initial discoveries that patterning of iEndos with BMP9 shifts cells towards a ‘lung-like’
molecular profile, including induction of the lung endothelial cell marker TMEM100, and enables durable
engraftment of transplanted iEndos into the mouse lung microvasculature. He also shows that this BMP9-
mediated patterning process requires active Notch signaling. Using this novel system, Dr. Holtz will test the
hypothesis that BMP9 and Notch signaling cooperatively induce TMEM100 expression to produce functional,
engraftable cells for treatment of monogenic pulmonary vascular disorders. Specifically, he will 1) assess the
differentiation capacity, longevity, and progenitor function of engrafted iEndos in the lung microvasculature; 2)
utilize a ‘competitive lung reconstitution assay’ to delineate the functional role of BMP9- and Notch-mediated
induction of TMEM100 to facilitate iEndo engraftment and to test the translational potential of iEndos derived
from gene-corrected PH patient-specific hiPSCs (BMPR2, FOXF1); and 3) test the efficacy of endothelial
replacement therapies in immunocompetent hosts using a mouse model of FOXF1-mediated pulmonary
vascular disease. This work will provide a fundamental advancement towards developing endothelial
replacement therapies for a broad range of congenital and acquired pulmonary vascular diseases. Dr. Holtz
has 90% protected time from Boston Children’s Hospital Division of Genetics and Genomics to accomplish
these aims under the guidance of Dr. Darrell Kotton at the Center for Regenerative Medicine at Boston
University/Boston Medical Center. He has assembled a remarkable team of advisors with diverse expertise to
assist in his career development and scientific research. Dr. Holtz details a comprehensive training plan that
takes advantage of his unique cross-institutional collaboration that includes mentored research, didactic
coursework, attendance and presentation at national meetings, preparation of manuscripts, and acquiring
additional grant support culminating in an R01. Dr. Holtz has the commitment of both institutions to accomplish
these goals and transition to an independent physician-scientist position by the end of the award.",Endothelial cell-based therapy for pulmonary vascular disease using induced pluripotent stem cells,"PROJECT NARRATIVE

"AI2Equity: AI Integrating SDOH Data to Advance Health Equity in Cardiovascular Risk Prediction
Abstract
Disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk exist among racial/ethnic minorities and lower socioeconomic
groups, where social determinants of health (SDOH) and structural social factors substantially contribute. The
underlying clinical, social, and intersectional structural factors are interconnected and complex. However, most
risk prediction models do not account for these factors and their complex interactions with clinical factors.
Machine learning (ML)-based approaches have been applied to this important problem, but most are limited in
terms of equity, SDOH integration, methodology advancement, interpretability enhancement, and generalizability.
To address these limitations, we will build an AI-powered, equitable, interpretable, actionable, and
generalizable CVD risk model to inform social and clinical interventions and reduce disparities among
racial/ethnic minorities and socially disadvantaged populations. With experts in AI/ML, clinical primary care,
SDOH and health equity, and biostatistics, our multidisciplinary team is well-suited to carry out this important
and timely study. We will apply advanced deep learning ML approaches to predict CVD risk and identify social
and clinical risk factors in diverse patient populations from one national community health center research
network (OCHIN) and two academic hospitals. First, we will develop a social-ecological AI model to improve
health equity (AI2Equity) in CVD risk prediction by integrating clinical factors and multi-domain, multi-level social
and structural factors into an advanced deep learning architecture (Aim 1). Second, we will enhance the
AI2Equity model’s fairness and interpretability through algorithmic optimization, explainable AI, and qualitative
study (Aim 2). Third, we will assess and improve AI2Equity’s generalizability across multiple healthcare
systems/settings and simulate its effectiveness compared to traditional CVD risk prediction tools (Aim 3). This
project provides a solid foundation for future clinical trials involving CVD prevention. The study aligns with NIH’s
commitment to “Leveraging the potential of AI/ML to accelerate the pace of biomedical innovation while
prioritizing and addressing health disparities and inequities.” Clinical decision support powered by AI2Equity,
leveraging social and clinical factors and their interactions, can better guide resources, promote health equity,
and steer multi-component interventions (e.g., clinical intervention, social support, and policy changes) in CVD
prevention. It will allow for more equitable CVD prevention interventions in racial/ethnic minorities and
socially disadvantaged groups and has the potential to reduce disparities.",AI2Equity: AI Integrating Social Determinants of Health to Advance Health Equity in Cardiovascular Risk Prediction,"AI2Equity: AI Integrating SDOH Data to Advance Health Equity in Cardiovascular Risk Prediction

"ABSTRACT
Obesity affects 2 out of 5 American adults and leads to high individual and societal costs. Behavioral
interventions focusing on diet and exercise can yield clinically significant weight loss of at least 5%. However,
the proportion of people who achieve this benchmark in behavioral weight loss trials is limited due to variable
and waning intervention adherence. One strategy to improve intervention adherence and weight loss is to
provide small monetary incentives for behaviors such as calorie logging or outcomes such as interim weight
loss. Current intervention structures are uniform, providing the same incentive timing and amount to all people.
Thus, some receive incentives even though they do not need them, while others do not receive enough
incentives to change their behavior. This uniform structure taxes limited budgets available for incentives. There
is an urgent need for a precision medicine approach that distributes incentives to people who respond to them.
To address this need, we apply reinforcement learning, a machine learning method, to create a precision
medicine intervention whereby each participant receives an individualized sequence of incentives to increase
the probability they achieve clinically significant weight loss. This novel approach takes data from cellular
scales and a dietary logging application to inform the prediction of participant behavior in response to incentive
amount. Using data from a previous incentives trial, we developed an algorithm with high predictive accuracy. We
plan to conduct a future randomized trial comparing the efficacy of this precision approach to a uniform approach on
weight loss. To prepare for the future trial, we will conduct a planning study with three aims: 1) Develop a digital
health platform to incorporate an existing commercial mathematical optimization modeling software for
prescriptive analytics to implement our algorithm. The platform will provide real-time analytics and deliver a
weekly incentive based on past behavior. We will develop a manual of procedures for detecting and resolving
errors for real-time data capture and processing.
2) Evaluate the feasibility of applying the algorithm
prospectively in a clinical trial. We will enroll two successive cohorts of adults with obesity in a single-arm
feasibility study and implement the personalized incentives intervention over six months. We will establish
logistical feasibility of executing the protocol and provide estimates of screening-to-enrollment, retention, and
incentives intervention response rates.
3) Characterize participant intervention acceptability as indicated by
intervention adherence rates, safety criteria, and feedback from qualitative interviews. Our findings will be used
to support a future, adequately powered randomized trial. If efficacious, our personalized intervention could
maximize return on investment for healthcare payers by optimally distributing a preset budget across a
population to maximize long-term, population-level weight loss in real-world settings.",Applying reinforcement learning to create a precision medicine weight loss intervention,"PROJECT NARRATIVE

program will receive a different sequence of financial incentives for weekly weight loss and calorie logging. In a

"Overview: This proposal directly addresses a critical public health challenge impacting pregnant and postpartum
persons in Zimbabwe: the prevention of HIV acquisition and transmission.
Background/Significance: The risk of HIV acquisition increases three- to four-fold in late pregnancy and early
postpartum. Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is safe during pregnancy, effective in preventing HIV, and
available in Zimbabwean antenatal care (ANC) clinics. However, PrEP use remains low among cisgender women
of reproductive age. Individual-, interpersonal/community-, and provider-level barriers (e.g., psychological
distress, stigma, low partner support, limited PrEP knowledge in providers) compromise use.
Preliminary studies: In this R34 application, we propose to develop a multi-level PrEP adherence and
persistence intervention as an adaptation and extension of our TENDAI (‘grateful’ in Shona) program, a problem-
solving approach to reduce depression and increase HIV treatment adherence among people living with HIV in
Zimbabwe. To develop TENDAI, we culturally adapted evidence-based adherence strategies and combined
them with problem-solving therapy for depression, targeting depressed mood as a pathway to reduced
antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence. In participants randomized to the intervention, TENDAI was associated
with increased ART adherence and decreased depression. Therefore, our Zimbabwe-, US-, and UK-based team
has the expertise required to extend TENDAI into a multi-level, problem-solving PrEP use intervention
(TENDAI4PrEP) for pregnant persons with psychological distress, their partners, and antenatal care providers.
Approach: TENDAI4PrEP will support PrEP adherence and persistence during pregnancy among individuals
with psychological distress who have agreed to initiate PrEP use. In Aim 1, we will explore the impact of
intersecting, multi-level barriers to PrEP uptake, adherence, and persistence among pregnant persons as well
as barriers to the provision of PrEP among antenatal care providers. In Aim 2, we will use the formative data to
specify the intervention, likely involving a patient component (inclusive of a dyadic session with a partner) and a
provider component, and conduct a small proof-of-concept trial. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the feasibility and
acceptability (primary outcomes) of (a) the patient-level intervention in a pilot RCT and (b) the provider-level
component in a pre-post design. Secondary outcomes of the RCT will be (1) self-reported PrEP adherence and
(2) psychological distress, both at the end of treatment, and (3) PrEP persistence (measured via dried blood
spots) at 3-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes of the provider component will be PrEP knowledge and PrEP
stigma. We will also explore key implementation outcomes among ANC providers and administrators.
Outcomes/next steps: These aims will lay the groundwork for a full-scale, hybrid effectiveness/implementation
trial which could dramatically improve rates of PrEP adherence and persistence during pregnancy and the
postpartum period, ultimately decreasing HIV prevalence in Zimbabwe.",TENDAI4PrEP: Adaptation of a problem-solving intervention to address individual and provider level barriers to PrEP uptake and adherence among pregnant persons in Zimbabwe,"PROJECT NARRATIVE
Zimbabwe’s HIV prevalence rate is among the highest globally, and cisgender women of reproductive age are
disproportionately affected. Considering the increased risk of HIV acquisition and transmission during
pregnancy, there is an urgent public health need to develop interventions that increase the use of efficacious
HIV prevention strategies like PrEP in the antenatal context. A multi-level, problem-solving intervention that
addresses barriers to PrEP adherence and persistence during pregnancy and through the postpartum
transition among patients, their partners, and antenatal care providers could improve the health of pregnant

"ABSTRACT
There is a major gap in our understanding of how paternal experiences leads to the increased risk of metabolic
disease in offspring. Here we focus on the heritable metabolic effects of benzene. Using a novel mouse model
for paternal benzene exposure, we provide convincing evidence for a causal relationship between paternal
benzene exposure and a sex specific offspring phenotype of impaired glycemic control when under metabolic
stress. We provide evidence for clear transcriptional signatures of metabolic disease, specifically in male
offspring. Based on these data we hypothesize that paternal benzene exposure triggers a specific signal in
sperm, which when transferred leads to predisposition to metabolic disease. To test the hypothesis, we will
utilize state of the art exposure system, a novel mouse model of intergenerational benzene exposure, and
pharmacological intervention to critically address the mechanism and pathophysiological significance
underlying metabolic programming triggered by benzene exposure. First we will perform in depth metabolic
and energy homeostasis phenotyping to identify the physiological consequences of paternal benzene exposure
in unexposed offspring. Second, we will identify the transcriptional signatures of intergenerational benzene
exposure in insulin sensitive tissues from offspring. Finally we will test if treatment of paternal metabolic
disease with a well characterized diabetes drug prevents the offspring phenotype; To define the mechanistic
basis for benzene-induced intergenerational reprograming, we will identify germline and epigenetic signatures
of benzene exposure, and mechanistically connect the epigenetic changes in the germline to offspring
transcriptional rewiring. The proposed research will, for the first time, define the causal relationship between
paternal exposure to benzene, and offspring metabolic disease susceptibility. Such a study will be of
importance to understand how paternal exposure drives non-genetic, metabolic reprogramming across
generations.",Molecular mechanisms underlying metabolic reprogramming by paternal benzene exposure,"PROJECT NARRATIVE
The proposed research is relevant to public health because the predisposing factors for metabolic disease are
largely unknown. Due to ethical and technical limitations of human studies the demonstration of causality is
impossible and mechanistic insights remain inaccessible. The project will use a newly developed mouse model
to study how paternal exposure to benzene, a major air pollutant, triggers an alternative offspring developmental
trajectory in offspring leading to increased susceptibility to metabolic disease.",https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/11034351,Address;Adhesives;Air Pollutants;Behavior;Benzene;Benzene Exposure;Closure by clamp;Communication;Communities;Conceptions;Continuous Glucose Monitor;DNA Methylation;DNA methylation profiling;Data;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Diet;Disease;Disease susceptibility;Dose;Embryo;Environmental Exposure;Epigenetic Process;Ethics;Etiology;Event;Exposure to;Fathers;Fertilization;Gene Expression Profile;Gene Expression Profiling;Generations;Genetic Transcription;Health;Heritability;Homeostasis;Human;Hyperglycemia;Hyperinsulinism;Impairment;Insulin;Intercept;Intervention;Measurable;Messenger RNA;Metabolic;Metabolic Diseases;Metabolic stress;Metabolism;Molecular;Motor Vehicles;Nature;Occupational Exposure;Oocytes;Paint;Paternal Exposure;Pattern;Petroleum;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Physiological;Population;Predisposing Factor;Predisposition;Public Health;RNA;Research;Risk;Rubber;Severities;Signal Transduction;Small RNA;Solvents;Source;System;Testing;Time;Tissues;Tobacco smoke;Vehicle Emissions;bisulfite sequencing;blastocyst;cigarette smoke;experience;glucose tolerance;glycemic control;improved;insight;insulin tolerance;interest;intergenerational;male;mouse model;non-genetic;novel;offspring;pharmacologic;prevent;programs;sex;sperm cell;transcriptome sequencing;transmission process;volatile organic compound;whole genome;zygote,11034351,1R56ES034765-01A1,,,,,,,,"['address', 'adhesives', 'air pollutants', 'behavior', 'benzene', 'benzene exposure', 'closure by clamp', 'communication', 'communities', 'conceptions', 'continuous glucose monitor', 'dna methylation', 'dna methylation profiling', 'data', 'development', 'diabetes mellitus', 'diet', 'disease', 'disease susceptibility', 'dose', 'embryo', 'environmental exposure', 'epigenetic process', 'ethics', 'etiology', 'event', 'exposure to', 'fathers', 'fertilization', 'gene expression profile', 'gene expression profiling', 'generations', 'genetic transcription', 'health', 'heritability', 'homeostasis', 'human', 'hyperglycemia', 'hyperinsulinism', 'impairment', 'insulin', 'intercept', 'intervention', 'measurable', 'messenger rna', 'metabolic', 'metabolic diseases', 'metabolic stress', 'metabolism', 'molecular', 'motor vehicles', 'nature', 'occupational exposure', 'oocytes', 'paint', 'paternal exposure', 'pattern', 'petroleum', 'pharmaceutical preparations', 'phenotype', 'physiological', 'population', 'predisposing factor', 'predisposition', 'public health', 'rna', 'research', 'risk', 'rubber', 'severities', 'signal transduction', 'small rna', 'solvents', 'source', 'system', 'testing', 'time', 'tissues', 'tobacco smoke', 'vehicle emissions', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'blastocyst', 'cigarette smoke', 'experience', 'glucose tolerance', 'glycemic control', 'improved', 'insight', 'insulin tolerance', 'interest', 'intergenerational', 'male', 'mouse model', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'offspring', 'pharmacologic', 'prevent', 'programs', 'sex', 'sperm cell', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transmission process', 'volatile organic compound', 'whole genome', 'zygote']",,
"PROJECT SUMMARY
Globally, gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV
and common mental illnesses, including depression and anxiety. The mental health of GBMSM is directly
affected by chronic exposure to sexual minority stressors, those that uniquely impact sexual minority individuals
via prejudice events, such as enacted stigma and violence, as well as anticipated and internalized stigma and
concealment of one’s sexual orientation. Behavioral interventions that address the multiple mental and sexual
health problems caused by chronic exposure to sexual minority stress among GBMSM are urgently needed. The
goal of this Career Development Award is to expand the candidate’s skillset and prepare him to conduct
independent research on scalable behavioral interventions that integrate mental health and HIV services for
sexual minority individuals in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Through a combination of didactic and
applied training and mentorship from leading experts, the candidate will develop expertise in 1) the systematic
adaptation of evidence-based interventions (EBI); 2) implementation science tools for identifying and evaluating
implementation strategies; 3) theory and analysis of mechanisms of change for mental health interventions; and
4) leading culturally appropriate intervention research in LMIC. The candidate will apply the knowledge and skills
gained through this training to conduct a pilot randomized control trial (RCT) in collaboration with Colectivo
Amigos contra el SIDA (CAS), a GBMSM-serving community clinic in Guatemala City with whom he has
extensively collaborated. Specifically, the candidate will adapt the ESTEEM (Effective Skills to Empower
Effective Men) intervention to target pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake for the Guatemalan context and to
identify implementation strategies (Aim 1). ESTEEM is a skills-building Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
intervention that was designed to reduce GBMSM’s co-occurring health risks by addressing the underlying
cognitive, affective, and behavioral pathways through which minority stress impairs health; it is effective at
improving mental health and HIV-related behaviors among GBMSM in the US and China. He will then pilot the
adapted intervention with 80 GBMSM to assess preliminary effectiveness on depression, anxiety, and PrEP
uptake, and explore mechanisms of change (Aim 2). Finally, he will assess acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity
of the adapted intervention and implementation strategies for future scale-up in other community clinic settings.
Findings from this research will inform the development of an R01 proposal for a hybrid type 1 implementation-
effectiveness trial to examine effectiveness and implementation sustainability of the scaled-up, adapted
intervention. Together, the training, research, and collaborations outlined in the award will support the testing of
a scalable mental health intervention with the potential to improve multiple common mental illnesses and PrEP
uptake among GBMSM in LMIC, contributing to NIMH’s goal of scaling up EBIs for underserved populations.",ESTEEM,"PROJECT NARRATIVE

"SUMMARY
The goal of this proposal is to investigate the dynamic changes in cerebrovascular morphology after acute
ischemic stroke and reperfusion therapy and also use cerebrovascular morphological features to improve stroke
outcome predictions. Stroke is among the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Acute Ischemic
stroke (AIS) constitutes approximately 90% of all strokes and is caused by a blockage or significant narrowing
of the brain vessels. The resultant disruption in the blood flow patterns downstream of the occlusion could place
the under-perfused regions of the brain at risk. Acute reperfusion therapies can restore the blood flow but vessel
recanalization and improve outcomes when performed early after AIS. A well-connected collateral supply
system, a redundant network of bypass vessels existing in the brain, is correlated with smaller final infarct size
and more favorable outcomes. However, a detailed evaluation of the collateral supply remains challenging due
to the small vessel size and network complexity. Timely diagnosis and treatment of AIS, as well as an accurate
prediction of response to reperfusion therapies, risk of major complications, and long-term outcomes, are pivotal
to patients, families, and providers to guide treatment pathways. However, accurate predictive models are
lacking despite efforts to use a large number of clinical and imaging biomarkers. Brain vascular morphology and
geometrical features have been shown to correlate with the development of cerebrovascular disorders. We
recently developed an automatic algorithm that can extract the brain’s vascular morphologic and geometric
features from the commonly used MR and CT angiograms in healthy subjects and AIS patients. We propose
developing further and validating this algorithm to automatically extract complex cerebrovascular morphology in
real-time. We also propose developing predictor models to accurately use the cerebrovascular morphologic
features, collateral index, and other clinical and imaging information collected at admission to predict major
complications and long-term outcomes after AIS.",Dynamic cerebrovascular morphology changes in acute ischemic stroke,"PROJECT NARRATIVE

"Abstract
 The impressive amount of data generated by experimental but mostly unsuccessful HIV/SIV vaccines
has led to the realization that protection will most likely requires 2 levels of barriers, the initial one at the
mucosal port of entry and if breached, a second set of systemic defenses. The capacity of humoral and cellular
immune responses in mucosal tissues to block or contain replication at the initial stage of virus transmission
may have a profound impact on the ability of a vaccinated host to resist infection, even when virus progresses
beyond the port of entry, allowing the systemic response more time to control or eradicate the incoming
pathogen.
 We hypothesized that there are two features necessary for a successful vaccine: 1) A prolonged if not
life-long stimulation of the immune system with viral antigens to maintain “alert” immune responses; and 2) a
targeted immune response at the site of primary HIV replication. A vaccine approach that simultaneously
addresses these two issues would have the potential to achieve solid, long-term active protection.
 To fulfill these requirements, we have developed an original strategy that successfully delivers a
vaccine to mucosal sites, providing antigen stimuli at recurrent intervals and elicit protective mucosal and
systemic immune responses. Our strategy leverages epithelial stem cells as permanent but non-expressing
source of viral antigen while their short-lived differentiated offspring express and present antigen to the local
immune system, along the mucosal surfaces of viral entry. Using a single cycle replicative-deficient SIV
(SIVsc) approach, which has been shown to be safe compared to traditional attenuated vaccines, we have
cloned the SIVsc genome under the control of the involucrin promoter (pINV-SIVsc), a terminally differentiated
keratinocyte specific promoter. When administered, the vaccine targets and transduces basal epithelial stem
cells from colorectal tissues. These cells then proliferate and differentiate into mature epithelial cells, triggering
SIV antigen expression via the promoter and leading to both direct and cross priming.
 For this project, we propose: 1) To confirm and further improve the efficacy and safety profile of the
pINV-SIVsc vaccine via the colorectal route; 2) To visualize and optimize vaccine delivery, and investigate the
mechanisms of action underlying protection; and 3) Using our best optimized vaccine strategy, demonstrate
protection from virus acquisition and/or viral replication in vivo and determine the correlates of protection or
control against repeated low-dose intrarectal challenges with heterologous SIV.",Intrarectal Immunization for a Barrier to Mucosal HIV Infection,"Narrative
A vaccine that will be effective in preventing HIV infection and also control virus replication once the virus has
taken hold, will require a dual barrier. The first one at the mucosal portal of entry for the virus to prevent or at
least minimize the ability of the virus to create a beachhead and two at the systemic level where generalized
immune responses are able to control virus that has succeeded in overcoming the first barrier. Our vaccine
strategy targets renewable colorectal epidermal stem cells as a permanent source of antigen production

"PROJECT SUMMARY
While the amygdala is a key focus in psychiatric treatments and invasive modulation of amygdala activity has
shown promise in treating certain refractory cases, its widespread use among millions of treatment-resistant
patients is impractical and entails inherent neurosurgery-related risks. The development of transcranial
magnetic stimulation (TMS) provides a potential noninvasive alternative. However, the effective modulation
of the amygdala with TMS
is hindered by
the lack of knowledge in pinpointing a TMS-accessible cortical site
that can reliably target and modulate the amygdala. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) emerges as
a promising candidate for stimulation based on findings from extensive preliminary data, published work, and
large human connectome datasets. The overall objective in this proposal to determine whether and how
DLPFC repetitive stimulation modulates the amygdala activity with an unparalleled combination of
invasive and noninvasive stimulation and recording methods in humans. The central hypothesis is that
both invasive and noninvasive stimulation of DLPFC modulate the amygdala activity through their functional
connectivity mechanism. This central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: determine
invasive modulatory effects of intracranial stimulation of DLPFC on the amygdala recorded with intracranial
EEG (iEEG) in epilepsy patients (Aim 1), translate stimulation with noninvasive TMS of DLPFC while tracking
modulatory effects on the amygdala with iEEG in epilepsy patients (Aim 2a) and with functional MRI in healthy
individuals (Aim 2b), and evaluate the role of DLPFC-amygdala functional connectivity in predicting
modulatory effects of DLPFC stimulation on the amygdala (Aim 3). The proposed research is innovative,
because it can determine a unique causal prefrontal pathway for noninvasive amygdala modulation in
humans. It also represents the first attempt of any group worldwide to creatively combine multimodal cutting-
edge brain stimulation and recordings to comprehensively evaluate modulatory effects of DLPFC stimulation
on the human amygdala. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide compelling
and conclusive causal evidence of amygdala modulation by DLPFC stimulation and inform a novel circuit-
based strategy that can efficiently pinpoint a stimulation site within the DLPFC for noninvasive amygdala
modulation. Ultimately, such knowledge will facilitate the rational design of personalized, circuit-guided
noninvasive neuromodulatory therapies aimed at modulating the amygdala for psychiatric disorders.",Mapping a Causal Prefrontal Pathway for Amygdala Modulation Utilizing Invasive and Noninvasive Brain Stimulation and Recording Methods in Humans,"PROJECT NARRATIVE

"PROJECT SUMMARY
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of disability that reduces productivity and quality of life at tremendous
economic cost. Despites its prevalence and cost, there is no therapy that prevents or cures OA. Synovial
inflammation (synovitis), has been linked with pain, disease severity and progression of knee OA and is
increasingly recognized for its role in the onset and pathogenesis of OA. However, studies of synovitis in OA
have been limited by a lack of non-invasive and non-contrast methods to evaluate its role in whole-joint disease,
particularly in early progression and in response to treatment. MRI has become the hallmark for imaging of OA
yet conventional MRI struggles to differentiate synovial hypertrophy from adjacent fluid, thus making it difficult to
identify and characterize synovitis. Contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI, following intravenous injection of a gadolinium-
based contrast-agent, provides contrast to the highly vascularized synovium and is the current reference
standard for imaging synovitis15. However, added time, cost, and contraindications in patients with renal
dysfunction, have limited use of CE-MRI in OA. There remains a critical need for new, validated, and translatable
imaging tools to better evaluate the role of synovitis in OA pathogenesis and response to treatment.
MRI has shown promise to use differences in relaxation and diffusion properties between synovium and joint
fluid to not only provide contrast to synovium but to also evaluate inflammatory activity without contrast injection.
However, technical challenges remain for detection of low-grade hypertrophy, as well as isolating synovium and
reducing distortions in diffusion MRI. Further, validation studies are necessary to understand these NC MRI
markers and evaluate their utility as a target to predict and monitor treatment response and OA progression
This project aims to develop and optimize non-contrast MRI methods to assess synovitis in knee OA, to validate
these methods against histology, and to evaluate their ability to predict whole joint disease progression and as
a target and monitor of treatment response. Our Specific Aims are (1a) to develop Non-Contrast MRI methods
for assessing synovial hypertrophy and inflammation across both knees; (1b) to validate the sensitivity and
specificity of these approaches against gold standard histologic measures of hypertrophy and inflammatory
markers and reference contrast-based imaging metrics; and [2] to evaluate the potential of NC-MRI synovitis
measures to predict and characterize treatment response to anti-inflammatory OA treatment (2a) as well as to
predict OA progression and evaluate whole-joint spatial tissue relationships (2b).
The significance of this work is new non-invasive and non-contrast tools that greatly expand the ability to
evaluate synovitis in all aspects of OA: early diagnosis, pathogenesis and progression, as well as endotype
evaluation and treatment monitoring. The innovation of this project is the development of novel NC methods to
assess synovitis in OA and its role in OA pathogenesis and response to treatment. Our investigative team
includes experts in novel imaging techniques, clinical and research studies of OA, and musculoskeletal clinicians.",Novel Non-Contrast MRI to Assess Synovitis in Osteoarthritis,"NARRATIVE

"Project Summary/Abstract
Abnormalities in feeding behaviors are a key symptom of several conditions, including binge-eating disorder,
anorexia and obesity. In order to develop novel treatments, it is imperative to gain a deeper understanding of the
circuits controlling adaptive feeding. Eating is affected by metabolic and hedonic features, and it consists of
several actions, including exploratory food-seeking and consumption. Despite its central clinical and biological
importance, networks controlling these behaviors are not well-understood. Prior data have indicated that
activation of several GABAergic inputs to the midbrain lateral and ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (l/vlPAG)
elicit hunting of insects in mice. However, the role of local l/vlPAG GABAergic cells in feeding is unknown.
Intriguingly, our preliminary data show that these cells encode food-seeking actions, such as approach to food
and consumption. Furthermore, activity in these ensembles, or of their projections to the subthalamic zona
incerta (ZI) are required for foraging leading to consumption of both prey and non-prey food. Here, we propose
to combine converging advances in neural activity recording, computational methods and molecular circuit
dissection tools to: 1. Characterize how l/vlPAG VGAT cells encode food sources and food-seeking behaviors
by recording the neural activity of large ensembles of cells with miniaturized microscopes. 2. Determine if activity
in the l/vlPAG circuit and their projection to the ZI is necessary and sufficient to promote foraging leading to
consumption, and 3. Dissect how the l/vlPAG input affects the ZI by combining ex vivo and in vivo recordings of
neural activity. Since prior reports show ZI activation induces feeding, we hypothesize that activation of the
inhibitory l/vlPAG input to ZI elicits feeding by disinhibiting the ZI. Importantly, feasibility for all proposed aims is
demonstrated in preliminary data and our prior publications, and we have successfully collaborated with all
participating key personnel. Taken together, execution of these aims will establish the function of a novel bottom-
up midbrain-subthalamic pathway that is vital for food-seeking actions, having direct implications for
understanding feeding mechanisms.",GABAergic Cells in the Periaqueductal Gray Region Control Food-Seeking,"Project Narrative
Dissecting the function of circuits controlling feeding is of vital importance to understand both adaptive eating as
well as conditions such as obesity and anorexia. Here, we propose to investigate the function of a cell population
in the midbrain that is not well-studied, but is a key control node of food-seeking, as shown in our preliminary
data. Successful execution of these aims will provide deep functional characterization of a previously unknown
circuit dedicated to food-seeking.",https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10901731,Affect;Anorexia;Appetitive Behavior;Axon;Behavior;Behavior Control;Binge Eating;Binge eating disorder;Biological;Biological Assay;Cells;Clinical;Collaborations;Computing Methodologies;Consumption;Data;Dedications;Desire for food;Disinhibition;Dissection;Eating;Eating Disorders;Exposure to;Feeding behaviors;Food;Fright;Future;Gryllidae;Health;Human Resources;Insecta;Lateral;Link;Maintenance;Metabolic;Microscope;Midbrain structure;Modality;Molecular;Mus;Neurons;Obesity;Optics;Outcome;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Population;Publications;Reporting;Research Personnel;Role;Slice;Source;Stimulus;Symptoms;Synapses;Testing;Water;approach behavior;feeding;hedonic;in vivo;insight;midbrain central gray substance;miniaturize;neural;neuroregulation;novel;optogenetics;tool;zona incerta,10901731,1R01DK139605-01,,,,,,,,"['affect', 'anorexia', 'appetitive behavior', 'axon', 'behavior', 'behavior control', 'binge eating', 'binge eating disorder', 'biological', 'biological assay', 'cells', 'clinical', 'collaborations', 'computing methodologies', 'consumption', 'data', 'dedications', 'desire for food', 'disinhibition', 'dissection', 'eating', 'eating disorders', 'exposure to', 'feeding behaviors', 'food', 'fright', 'future', 'gryllidae', 'health', 'human resources', 'insecta', 'lateral', 'link', 'maintenance', 'metabolic', 'microscope', 'midbrain structure', 'modality', 'molecular', 'mus', 'neurons', 'obesity', 'optics', 'outcome', 'pathway interactions', 'pattern', 'population', 'publications', 'reporting', 'research personnel', 'role', 'slice', 'source', 'stimulus', 'symptoms', 'synapses', 'testing', 'water', 'approach behavior', 'feeding', 'hedonic', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'midbrain central gray substance', 'miniaturize', 'neural', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'tool', 'zona incerta']",,
"ABSTRACT
Impaired wound healing is an alarming problem in diabetes, attributed to the development of over 750,000
diabetic foot ulcerations (DFU) and 70,000 lower extremity amputations per year in the USA. Single-cell RNA-
sequencing (scRNASeq) analysis provides valuable insights into transcriptional features and disease
pathophysiology by allowing the profiling of individual cells in heterogeneous tissues. A recently conducted study
in our unit primarily focused on divergent characteristics between DFU patients who healed their ulcers (Healers)
and those who failed to heal them (non-Healers) and investigated molecular changes via scRNASeq analysis of
surgically removed DFUs. Our analysis revealed the enrichment of a unique population of fibroblasts,
overexpressing MMP1, MMP3, MMP11, HIF1A, CHI3L1, and TNFAIP6 genes in the Healers. Ongoing work in
our lab has shown that specifically designed alginate bandages that can provide controlled lipid nanoparticle
(LNPs) delivery of modified CHI3L1mRNA, IL-17AmRNA, FGF-2 and IL-2mRNA considerably improve wound
healing in diabetic db/db mice. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that topical wound treatment with new
biomaterials that can release the above mRNAs can lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches.
Furthermore, we hypothesize that combination of various mRNAs with specific temporal delivery can
physiologically imitate the activation of pathways that are associated with DFU healing.
To fully explore our hypotheses, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1.) Develop a modified-mRNA-LNPs
therapeutics delivery system to target different stages of diabetic wound healing and provide proof of concept
regarding their efficacy in wounds of diabetic mice. Alginate hydrogels fabricated into bandages capable of
sustained release will be employed to deliver mRNA-LNPs in 3D human skin equivalents and wounds of db/db
mice. We will identify the most efficient mRNA or combination and the most appropriate dosing and timing of
delivery in improving diabetic wound repair. 2.) Investigate efficacy in a larger animal model, the diabetic Yucatan
minipig and confirm mechanisms of action in both animal models. We will also examine mechanisms of action
of pro-healing mRNA(s) and will compare them to the results from the rodent studies. 3.) Conduct translational
studies in human diabetic wound healing to verify the therapeutic potential. We will conduct ex vivo wound
healing studies with discarded skin from patients with and without diabetes and in vivo studies with wounding of
human skin engrafted onto diabetic nude mice. We will also employ targeted multi-omics analyses to establish
molecular mechanisms of action and compare them with the ones that have been observed in our previous
extensive human studies. We believe that our proposal involves state-of-the-art “bench to bedside” research that
can culminate in the development of innovative new therapeutic approaches. Successful completion of the
project will facilitate the conduction of Phase I/II clinical trials in DFU patients.",Use of Modified mRNA for the Treatment of Diabetic Foot Ulceration,"NARRATIVE

"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Multiple epidemics converge in the lived experiences of those at multiple intersecting minoritized social
positions. People who identify as women experience gender-based violence, are vulnerable to HIV
transmission, and face grave structural social inequities that contribute to poor health outcomes. In particular,
minoritized women – BIPOC women, transgender (or trans) women, and BIPOC trans women (the
intersectional interplay of minoritized sex, gender and race/ethnicity) – are at heightened vulnerability. Today’s
contemporary social, legal, and cultural environment threatens the rights of women, especially minoritized
women, in a milieu with a growing absence of protections for reproductive health, gender affirmative care, self-
determination, and bodily autonomy. The systemic divestment of power away from women promotes a society
whose structures are emboldened to perpetuate oppressive intersectional ideologies that make women more
vulnerable to HIV transmission and poorer health outcomes. Disparities in HIV prevalence and care are
especially high among trans women of color and cis women of color, creating a disparity within a disparity.
Educational opportunities to advance gender and health justice research and practice are critical to end these
multiple intersectional epidemics. Our proposed project includes several short courses designed to
complement and enhance the training of a new generation of the public health workforce in diverse career
stages to gain strong understanding and skills in methods to advance the intersection of HIV prevention and
gender and health justice. Our focus will be on undergraduate students, MPH students, and community health
workers. The proposed project will build on the intellectual capital and infrastructure of the world-class
University of California Center for Gender and Health Justice.

"Sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-
1RA) are rapidly changing the therapeutic landscape for patients with diabetes and kidney disease, but are
underutilized in high-risk populations. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have robustly demonstrated the
cardiovascular and renoprotective benefits of these agents. For the first time in decades, we have new drugs to
slow kidney disease progression, yet newer medication classes are still underprescribed in patients with DKD.
One of the major prescribing barriers is the lack of safety data in real-world patients with DKD, a
complex, older population with multimorbidity and polypharmacy, who are at greater risk for adverse events
and drug-drug interactions (DDIs), but who are underrepresented or excluded from RCTs. This dearth of safety
data cannot be addressed by RCTs, since the RCTs were powered for effectiveness, not safety, did not
represent real-world patients with DKD who are an older, frailer population, and did not address DDIs in this
population with a high burden of polypharmacy. Yet, over time, these drugs should and will be prescribed to a
broader spectrum of patients with DKD. Methodologically rigorous studies using large, national healthcare
databases are an ideal vehicle to address these knowledge gaps with much larger sample sizes than in RCTs

the safety of newer diabetes medications in real-world patients with DKD. We will investigate kidney-related
and other safety outcomes that were not systematically evaluated in RCTs in patients with DKD, using a new-
user, active comparator cohort approach (Aim 1). We will develop two safety monitoring approaches to assess
both anticipated and unanticipated adverse event signals associated with the newer diabetes medications as
they are used in real-world patients with DKD (Aim 2). Patients with DKD are at higher risk for DDIs since they
are older with impaired kidney function and have more multimorbidity and polypharmacy. We propose a novel
two-stage screening approach to detect and evaluate clinically relevant drug-drug interactions that could affect
the safety profile of newer diabetes medications in patients with DKD (Aim 3). This proposal will advance our
understanding of these drugs’ safety and, thus, will help overcome barriers to prescribing in patients with DKD
who may largely benefit from them. The filling of critical knowledge gaps and new insights regarding safe
prescribing will significantly influence the clinical management of patients with DKD.",Optimizing the Safety of the Newer Diabetes Medications in Patients with Diabetes and Kidney Disease,"While the newer classes of diabetes medications have shown clinical benefits in patients with diabetic

"Project Abstract
NOX2-derived oxidative stress produced by T cells contributes to the development of maternal
syndrome in the Dahl salt-sensitive rat. Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy-specific disorder that is
characterized by hypertension and proteinuria (maternal syndrome) developing after the 20th week of gestation.
PE is the leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States, affecting about 5-7% of
pregnancies. Furthermore, women with preexisting hypertension or chronic kidney disease have an increased
risk for developing PE. With rates of PE rising in the United States, the exact mechanism(s) responsible for the
pathogenesis of the disease remain undetermined. The current notion of the pathogenesis of PE is thought to
be a two-step process: 1) improper placentation and remodeling of the spiral arteries and 2) development of
maternal syndrome. Current animal models require either a surgical or pharmacologic intervention to develop
PE-like phenotypes; however, these models are not capable of investigating the first step in the disease process.
Our preliminary data demonstrate that the Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rat is just such an animal model to help
investigate mechanisms of PE since it spontaneously develops PE while remaining on a low salt (0.4% NaCl)
diet. The present studies will test the central hypothesis that maternal syndrome in Dahl SS rats is an outcome
of improper placentation leading to the infiltration of T cells into kidney and placental tissues causing subsequent
release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that contributes to endothelial dysfunction and the development
hypertension and renal damage. To test this hypothesis, three specific aims are proposed. AIM 1 will first test
the hypothesis that T cell derived ROS (NOX2-derived) causes maternal syndrome in Dahl SS rats utilizing a
novel splenocyte transfer approach. AIM 2 will demonstrate that T-cell derived ROS results in endothelial
dysfunction that develops in maternal syndrome. Interestingly, this maternal syndrome phenotype occurs in a
divergent fashion with about 50% of SS rats developing maternal and the other half are protected. AIM 3 will
investigate the renal dysfunction that occurs during PE and the increased risk of developing chronic kidney
disease leading to increased mortality in Dahl SS rats. This maternal syndrome phenotype is consistent with
what is observed in clinical settings, and this model provides a unique opportunity to study the whole disease
process of PE. Completion of the studies in this proposal will establish the interaction between T cell-derived
ROS and endothelial function in PE to better understand the underlying mechanisms of PE.",Nox2-derived oxidative stress produced by T cells contributes to the development of maternal syndrome in the Dahl salt-sensitive rat.,"Project Narrative

"Summary: Dura is the fibrous membrane that covers the brain and spine. Perforations in the dura (durotomy)
such as punctures, incisions or lacerations are often encountered during cranial and spinal surgery and require
repair and sealing to prevent serious and occasionally fatal complications related to leakage of cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF). Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) procedures of the brain and spine significantly limit direct repair of
durotomies by traditional methods such as suture or staple closure, due to a combination of restricted working
space and access vectors and limited field of view (constrained deployment), and the often-friable nature of the
perforated dura. PatchClamp MedTech, Inc. is developing novel devices to enable rapid, safe, and immediate
watertight repair and sealing of durotomies encountered during MIS and open craniospinal procedures. A low-
profile, single-hand disposable applicator enables the surgeon to place a tissue or synthetic graft through a
narrow MIS access port onto the inner surface of the perforated dura and secure it in place with a clasp released
onto the outer dural surface. Prototypes using high resolution 3D printed bioabsorbable subcomponents and
commercially available synthetic dural substitutes have provided proof-of-concept. In this proposal, we refine
and test the efficacy of the device under a variety of frequently encountered MIS constraints in vitro and demon-
strate a stable watertight seal in vivo. Ease of application, sealing efficacy and survey feedback from surgeons
deploying the graft in this model will guide sequential modifications and scaling of the device. Aim 1. Assess
mechanical attributes of device components and dural sealing performance in vitro in unconstrained
access. Using clinically relevant burst pressure chamber models, we will assess the following attributes: easy
loading and release of the graft from the applicator, atraumatic passage of the graft through the dural perforation
with rapid re-expansion, precise release of the extradural clasp struts, elastic reformation of the struts against
the membrane after release, measurement of the force applied by the struts to the external surface of the mem-
brane, minimum strut force to maintain stability against lateral movement, and ability to unclasp and re-position
or remove the graft after initial deployment. We will demonstrate that the deployed graft maintains a watertight
seal under escalating pulsatile pressure in comparison to current dural closure techniques. Aim 2. Assess per-
formance in vitro under constrained access conditions. We will assess visualization, access, deployment,
and sealing efficacy compared to current dural closure techniques under constrained access models simulating
MIS approaches using a lumbar soft tissue simulator with both a pressurized acrylic burst chamber as well as a
pressurized spine laminotomy model. Surgeon input will guide design iterations. Aim 3. Demonstrate sealing
performance in vivo. The refined prototype will be used to test device graft deployment and sealing compared
to conventional dural closure in an acute pig laminectomy durotomy model. Successful completion will lead to
preclinical IDE-enabling work in preparation for first-in-human trials.",Novel device for the repair and sealing of dural perforations in minimally invasive surgery,"Narrative: Surgical perforations in the dura, the thick membrane of dense connective tissue surrounding the
brain and spinal cord, require repair and sealing to prevent leakage of cerebrospinal fluid associated with serious
complications such as infection, intractable headaches, or wound breakdown. Current dura repair methods such
as suturing, stapling, grafts, and tissue adhesives are often ineffective at providing an immediate watertight clo-
sure, resulting in poor outcomes and appreciable loss of time and money, including additional procedures and
inpatient care to re-establish dural integrity. We address this problem with the PatchClamp surgical device to
enable immediate watertight closure of the dura in either open or minimally invasive surgery, enabling the sur-
geon ease and flexibility of application within restricted working space and access vectors, thereby reducing
operating room time and expense and complications, substantial morbidity, and costs related to postoperative
cerebrospinal fluid leakage.",https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10818254,3D Print;Acute;Address;Animals;Brain;Calibration;Cephalic;Cerebrospinal Fluid;Cessation of life;Clinical Trials;Complex;Consumption;Coupling;Dense Connective Tissue;Development;Devices;Dura Mater;Elasticity;Extravasation;FDA approved;Failure;Family suidae;Feedback;Goals;Hand;In Vitro;Infection;Intractable Headaches;Laceration;Laminectomy;Lateral;Length of Stay;Measurement;Mechanics;Medical Device;Membrane;Methods;Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures;Modeling;Modification;Morbidity - disease rate;Movement;Nature;Neurosurgeon;Operating Rooms;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Perforation;Performance;Phase;Polymers;Positioning Attribute;Postoperative Period;Preparation;Procedures;Puncture procedure;Radial;Regulatory Pathway;Resolution;Rotation;Secure;Shapes;Small Business Innovation Research Grant;Spinal Cord;Spine surgery;Structure;Surface;Surgeon;Surgical Clamps;Surgical Wound Dehiscence;Surgical incisions;Surgical sutures;Surveys;System;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Thick;Time;Tissue Adhesives;Tissues;Training;Vertebral column;Vision;Visualization;Work;biomaterial compatibility;care costs;clinically relevant;comparative efficacy;cost;cranium;design;disability;efficacy testing;fabrication;first-in-human;flexibility;grasp;improved;in vivo;in vivo evaluation;inpatient service;mechanical properties;meetings;minimally invasive;mortality;neurosurgery;novel;patch clamp;poly(lactic acid);pre-clinical;pressure;prevent;prototype;repaired;restoration;seal;skull base;soft tissue;tool;vector,10818254,1R43NS135645-01,,,,,,,,"['3d print', 'acute', 'address', 'animals', 'brain', 'calibration', 'cephalic', 'cerebrospinal fluid', 'cessation of life', 'clinical trials', 'complex', 'consumption', 'coupling', 'dense connective tissue', 'development', 'devices', 'dura mater', 'elasticity', 'extravasation', 'fda approved', 'failure', 'family suidae', 'feedback', 'goals', 'hand', 'in vitro', 'infection', 'intractable headaches', 'laceration', 'laminectomy', 'lateral', 'length of stay', 'measurement', 'mechanics', 'medical device', 'membrane', 'methods', 'minimally invasive surgical procedures', 'modeling', 'modification', 'morbidity - disease rate', 'movement', 'nature', 'neurosurgeon', 'operating rooms', 'operative surgical procedures', 'outcome', 'perforation', 'performance', 'phase', 'polymers', 'positioning attribute', 'postoperative period', 'preparation', 'procedures', 'puncture procedure', 'radial', 'regulatory pathway', 'resolution', 'rotation', 'secure', 'shapes', 'small business innovation research grant', 'spinal cord', 'spine surgery', 'structure', 'surface', 'surgeon', 'surgical clamps', 'surgical wound dehiscence', 'surgical incisions', 'surgical sutures', 'surveys', 'system', 'techniques', 'technology', 'testing', 'thick', 'time', 'tissue adhesives', 'tissues', 'training', 'vertebral column', 'vision', 'visualization', 'work', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'care costs', 'clinically relevant', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cranium', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy testing', 'fabrication', 'first-in-human', 'flexibility', 'grasp', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo evaluation', 'inpatient service', 'mechanical properties', 'meetings', 'minimally invasive', 'mortality', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'patch clamp', 'poly(lactic acid)', 'pre-clinical', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'repaired', 'restoration', 'seal', 'skull base', 'soft tissue', 'tool', 'vector']",,
"PROJECT SUMMARY
Systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) are essential tools in evidence-based medicine and
comparative effectiveness research, enabling thorough evaluations of treatment benefits and risks. In the context
of the COVID-19 pandemic, SRs and MAs have been extensively utilized to provide timely insights on preventive
interventions, therapeutic medications, and vaccines, aiding informed decision-making and response strategies.
However, traditional SRs have limitations such as redundant publications, inconsistent inclusion criteria, and
inadequate investigation of evidence accumulation. Living systematic reviews (LSRs) have emerged as a
dynamic approach to continuously update and synthesize evidence, addressing these limitations. LSRs offer
benefits such as timeliness, reduction of research waste, identification of research gaps, and integration of the
latest evidence. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) is a valuable tool to derive conclusive evidence for assessing
the adequacy of studies in LSRs. By providing monitoring and futility boundaries, TSA ensures reliable decision-
making regarding a treatment’s effectiveness or futility. Conclusive evidence can save patients from harmful
treatments or placebos, and redirect resources to other research areas. However, the current TSA methods have
significant limitations, mainly stemming from their heavy reliance on interim analyses of RCTs, where patients
tend to be more homogeneous than those in MAs that consist of multiple studies on different populations.
This proposed project aims to advance TSA methods by developing innovative approaches to establishing
decision boundaries, specifically targeting the improvement of early-stage TSAs and reducing the risk of
premature termination of LSRs. By addressing between-study heterogeneity and enhancing statistical methods,
this project seeks to enhance the reliability and timeliness of living evidence. Rigorous validation of the proposed
methods for TSAs will be conducted through extensive simulation studies carefully designed to evaluate the
overall type I and type II error rates of treatment effect estimates. Additionally, the performance of the proposed
methods will be assessed using diverse real-world datasets. Furthermore, user-friendly, open-source software
will be developed, accompanied by comprehensive instructions and examples, ensuring accessibility and ease
of implementation for biostatisticians and clinicians. In conclusion, these novel TSA methods hold broad
applicability across medical fields, including infectious diseases and cancers, facilitating more robust
assessments of existing evidence, guiding decisions regarding the necessity of new randomized controlled trials,
and ultimately advancing comparative effectiveness research and evidence-based medicine.",Advanced Methods and Software for Trial Sequential Analysis in Living Systematic Reviews,"PROJECT NARRATIVE

"Abstract
This proposal is to produce IND-enabling data for supporting clinical trials of an attenuated clone
of the mouse-adapted Chlamydia muridarum (CM) as a novel oral vaccine known as intrOv for
protecting humans from sexually transmitted infection with Chlamydia trachomatis (CT).
Extensive searching for a subunit vaccine against CT has not produced a licensed vaccine. One
of the challenges is that all 8 STI-causing CT serovars (D to K) are significant human pathogens
globally. We are proposing to develop intrOv into an oral vaccine against 8 CT serovars. Following
a single oral inoculation, CM can establish long-lasting colonization in the mouse gastrointestinal
(GI) tract but without causing any significant pathologies; Oral CM induces Th1-dominant
transmucosal immunity against subsequent infection in the genital tract and airway but without
altering CM colonization in the GI tract; CM colonization in the GI tract for 1 week is sufficient for
inducing protective immunity in the genital tract and antibiotics clearance of GI tract CM does not
compromise the genital protective immunity; To improve the safety of CM as an oral vaccine,
genital tract pathogenicity-attenuated CM clones have been generated by various labs but the
clone designated as intracellular Oral vaccine vector or intrOv is particularly attractive since it is
still able to induce transmucosal protection in the genital tract but no longer maintains long-lasting
colonization in the colon; IntrOv induces IFN+ILC3s and is also inhibited by IFN+ILC3s; Finally
intrOv-induced transmucosal immunity conferred cross-species protection against CT in the
genital tract, validating previously observed CM induction of anti-CT immunity. Thus, we
hypothesize that oral intrOv protects human genital tract from CT infection and the intrOv-induced
IFN+ILC3s in the gut may present cross-species epitopes to lymphocytes for mediating Th1-
dorminant transmucosal immunity. We will test these hypotheses by validating the protection
efficacy of intrOv against genital CT in mice and large animals, identifying protective correlates
and CT antigens for improving clinical assays & intrOv efficacy and improving the quality and
safety of intrOv as a human oral vaccine. Our hypotheses are consistent with these successful
examples of using animal-adapted microbes to protect against human pathogens: cowpox as a
vaccine against smallpox, BCG (M. bovis) against M. tuberculosis and meningococcal vaccine
against gonorrhoea.",An oral vaccine against Chlamydia trachomatis,"Narrative

"PROJECT SUMMARY
The brain serotonin (5-HT) system has been a target for multiple weight loss therapies. Compounds that elevate
5-HT content reduce food intake and body weight. Our previous and current findings show that 5-HT acts on two
postsynaptic 5-HT receptors, Htr2c and Htr1b in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARH) to suppress
food intake. Within the ARH, 5-HT reciprocally inhibits the orexigenic AgRP neurons (via Htr1b) while activating
the anorectic POMC neurons (via Htr2c). Moreover, we have demonstrated that Htr2c and Htr1b in these neurons
are necessary for the anorectic effects of 5-HT agents including the once-popular diet pill Fen/Phen.
However, despite these significant findings, the precise source of the presynaptic 5-HT inputs to ARH neurons
remains largely elusive. This has posed a considerable challenge due to the heterogeneity of 5-HT neurons in
the midbrain dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), comprising multiple subpopulations with distinct projection patterns
and physiological functions. Consequently, our current proposal aims to unravel the neural circuit mechanism by
which 5-HT regulates satiety.
To accomplish this, we propose a multidisciplinary approach to isolate the 5-HT neurons that innervate the ARH
(5-HTARH neurons). Our central hypothesis posits that these neurons provide direct synaptic inputs to the ARH
and play a critical role in feeding regulation. To investigate this, we will use in vivo calcium imaging to determine
the activity patterns of 5-HTARH neurons during hunger and satiety in behaving mice [Aim 1a]. Furthermore, we
will manipulate the activity of these neurons in live mice by either stimulating or inhibiting them, aiming to uncover
their specific contributions to food intake [Aim 1b]. Finally, we have developed a new intersectional genetic
approach that enables us to selectively deplete 5-HT inputs to the ARH in adult mice and evaluate their
physiological impact on energy homeostasis [Aim 2].",Deconstruct Raphe Serotonin Neurons that Regulate Satiety,"PROJECT NARRATIVE

"PROJECT SUMMARY
Anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent psychiatric conditions in adolescents and are associated with
functional impairment and symptomatic distress. When untreated, they result in persistent disability into
adulthood. Moreover, nearly 40% of pediatric patients with anxiety disorders fail to respond to the first-line
psychopharmacologic treatment—selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)—and up to 70% will
experience treatment-limiting side effects. Identifying predictors of treatment response in pediatric patients
provides an opportunity to (1) optimize treatment, (2) forestall the development of secondary psychopathology
and suicide attempts and (3) restore normal psychosocial function and quality of life. In this regard, in adults,
pharmacogenetically (PGx)-guided antidepressant treatment increases efficacy, decreases side effect burden
and reduces treatment costs; however, these PGx studies involving adults focus almost exclusively on
medication selection rather than dosing. Currently, there are no such pediatric trials. Despite the availability of
PGx dosing guidelines for adults, blinded, randomized trials of PGx-guided SSRI dosing have never been
conducted (even in adults). Compared to adults, SSRI-related side effects and pharmacokinetics significantly
differ in adolescents. This proposal aims to test whether PGx-guided dosing of the SSRI, escitalopram,
improves efficacy and tolerability in adolescents with anxiety disorders. We will measure treatment response
with the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS, a validated measure of pediatric anxiety symptom severity)
after 12 weeks of escitalopram treatment. Additionally, activation and weight gain—two significant side effects
of SSRIs in youth—will be assessed with the Treatment Emergent Activation and Suicidality Assessment
Profile and body mass index (BMI) during the 12 week trial. Adolescents with anxiety disorders (N=132) will be
randomized (1:1) to receive (1) standard or (2) PGx-guided escitalopram dosing. We expect greater reduction
in PARS scores over time (i.e., better response) with PGx-guided dosing compared to standard dosing.
Further, we expect more patients to experience activation and treatment-related BMI increases with standard
dosing compared to PGx-guided dosing. Additionally, we will examine the influence of CYP2C19 metabolizer
status on escitalopram pharmacokinetics and will determine the impact of serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) and
receptor (HTR2A) variants on treatment response. For treatment of pediatric anxiety to move beyond the
current ""one-size fits all"" approach, PGx-guided SSRI dosing strategies are urgently needed. This study will
provide clinicians, patients, parents, and payers the evidence to determine whether PGx-guided escitalopram
dosing in pediatric anxiety disorders has clinical utility.",Improving the Effectiveness and Safety of Escitalopram in Pediatric Anxiety,"PROJECT NARRATIVE

"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) is the most common HPV-
related cancer in the U.S. While vaccinations against HPV are available, they will not substantially reduce
incidence until 2060. In the absence of screening programs, patients typically present with advanced disease
requiring treatment with lifelong consequences and early mortality. Two blood-based biomarkers, serum
antibodies to HPV16 early (E) oncoproteins (HPV16 E Abs) and circulating tumor-modified HPV DNA
(ctmHPVDNA), are highly sensitive and specific. Persistent oncogenic HPV at anogenital sites is a biomarker of
anal and cervical cancer risk, though limited data exists on oral oncogenic HPV natural history and persistence
as a risk factor for HPV-related OPC. This proposal capitalizes on a funded (CPRIT: RP2000025) OPC screening
trial (1500 men; TRINITY Study: NCT 02897427) and would extend this work outside of a clinical trial design to
explore both novel assays and self-collection and include women and those with limited health care access.
Objective: To evaluate test characteristics, feasibility, and acceptance of non-invasive self-collected samples for
HPV-related cancer screening and monitoring. Hypothesis: Novel self-sampling approaches / assays are feasible
with equivalent performance to clinic-based / blood sampling and will be acceptable to both patients and the
general population. To accomplish these objectives, the following specific aims are proposed:
Aim 1: OPC Patient Cohort: To establish test characteristics of novel ctmHPVDNA and HPV16 E Ab
assays using self-collected oral rinse, unstimulated saliva, and urine samples compared to tumor HPV
status and clinic-based / blood samples.
Aim 2: General Population Cohort: To document the feasibility of remote self-sampling (oral rinse, saliva,
and urine) for novel ctmHPVDNA and HPV16 E Ab assays, as well as presence of oral oncogenic HPV.
Design: A prospective cohort study of 100 patients with OPC (Aim 1), and 1,100 individuals aged 45-69 years
from the general population (Aim 2). Presence of ctmHPVDNA will be determined using the NavDx assay
(Naveris, Waltham, MA). HPV16 E Ab testing will be performed using a RAPID ELISA (ASU). Oral oncogenic
HPV testing of oral rinse samples will be completed using Roche Cobas system with type-specific analysis using
the SPF10-PCR-DEIA-LiPA25 assay. For Aim 1, test characteristics of the biomarker assays will be calculated
based on the reference standard, OPC tumor HPV status. The new tests will also be compared to the non-
reference standard (blood). For Aim 2, descriptive statistics will document successful completion rates of self-
sampling and subsequent assay testing, and clinical findings described for the biomarker positive. Prevalence
and 18-month persistence of oral oncogenic HPV will also be documented for the general population cohort.",HPV-related Oropharyngeal Cancer Screening and Monitoring through Remote Self-Sampling,"PROJECT NARRATIVE
While there are effective, widely available methods for cervical cancer screening, there are no such screening
programs for human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal cancer (OPC), even though there are more
cases per year of OPC than there are of cervical cancer. Exciting new ways of detection are using peripheral
blood collected in a clinical setting; however, if remote self-sampling could be reliably used instead, it would offer
a non-invasive alternative for screening the general population and for post-treatment monitoring of patients with
HPV-related OPC. Screening using saliva, oral rinse, and urine sampling 1) offers the advantage of making
mailed sample collection possible, 2) increases the likelihood of regular screening, even for those living in remote
geographic areas or with limited health care access, and 3) potentially prevents late diagnosis of OPC which
requires more aggressive treatment with serious lifelong consequences and early non-cancer mortality.",https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10882873,"Adult;Aftercare;Antibodies;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Blood;Blood specimen;Cancer Patient;Cervical Cancer Screening;Characteristics;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Trials Design;Collection;Controlled Clinical Trials;DNA;Data;Detection;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Foundations;Funding;General Population;Geographic Locations;Goals;HPV oropharyngeal cancer;HPV-High Risk;Home;Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination;Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignant Neoplasm;Human Papillomavirus;Human papillomavirus 16;Image;Incidence;Individual;Infection;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of anus;Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri;Methods;Monitor;Natural History;Oncogenic;Oncoproteins;Oral;Outcome;Patient Monitoring;Patients;Peer Review Grants;Performance;Persons;Population;Prevalence;Prospective, cohort study;Publications;Recurrent Malignant Neoplasm;Reference Standards;Research Institute;Risk;Risk Factors;Saliva;Sampling;Screening for cancer;Serum;Shipping;Site;System;Testing;Texas;Urine;Vaccination;Woman;Work;advanced disease;aged;aggressive therapy;anti-cancer research;antibody test;blood-based biomarker;cancer prevention;cancer recurrence;cancer risk;cohort;design;health care availability;high risk;high risk population;malignant oropharynx neoplasm;men;middle age;migration;mortality;novel;oral HPV;peripheral blood;population based;prevent;public health priorities;risk prediction;saliva sample;sample collection;screening;screening program;statistics;success;tumor",10882873,1U01DE032997-01A1,,,,,,,,"['adult', 'aftercare', 'antibodies', 'biological assay', 'biological markers', 'blood', 'blood specimen', 'cancer patient', 'cervical cancer screening', 'characteristics', 'clinic', 'clinical', 'clinical trials design', 'collection', 'controlled clinical trials', 'dna', 'data', 'detection', 'development', 'diagnosis', 'disease', 'enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay', 'foundations', 'funding', 'general population', 'geographic locations', 'goals', 'hpv oropharyngeal cancer', 'hpv-high risk', 'home', 'human papilloma virus vaccination', 'human papilloma virus-related malignant neoplasm', 'human papillomavirus', 'human papillomavirus 16', 'image', 'incidence', 'individual', 'infection', 'malignant neoplasms', 'malignant neoplasm of anus', 'malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'methods', 'monitor', 'natural history', 'oncogenic', 'oncoproteins', 'oral', 'outcome', 'patient monitoring', 'patients', 'peer review grants', 'performance', 'persons', 'population', 'prevalence', 'prospective, cohort study', 'publications', 'recurrent malignant neoplasm', 'reference standards', 'research institute', 'risk', 'risk factors', 'saliva', 'sampling', 'screening for cancer', 'serum', 'shipping', 'site', 'system', 'testing', 'texas', 'urine', 'vaccination', 'woman', 'work', 'advanced disease', 'aged', 'aggressive therapy', 'anti-cancer research', 'antibody test', 'blood-based biomarker', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer risk', 'cohort', 'design', 'health care availability', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'men', 'middle age', 'migration', 'mortality', 'novel', 'oral hpv', 'peripheral blood', 'population based', 'prevent', 'public health priorities', 'risk prediction', 'saliva sample', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'screening program', 'statistics', 'success', 'tumor']",,
"Project Summary
Without significant additional political leadership, investment and further scientific advance, the global
response to HIV/AIDS is not on track to achieve the 2030 goal of ending AIDS as a public health threat.
This is due to continued high rates of incident HIV infection in multiple communities, populations,
countries, and regions. While HIV science has made remarkable advances, implementation of highly
effective prevention and treatment options remains challenging. Taken together, these realities
underscore that the HIV response must be global to succeed, that HIV research and training efforts
must also be global and multidisciplinary, and that actors in all sectors of the HIV response are needed
to address our shared goal of reducing HIV as a threat to global health and individual wellbeing. To
respond to this imperative, the 25th International AIDS Conference, AIDS 2024, will convene the HIV
community in Munich, Germany, and virtually in July 2024.
AIDS 2024 will bring together clinicians and people living with HIV, community leaders and policy
makers, basic scientists, junior investigators, donors, journalists, and experts from law, policy and
program implementation. This diversity is essential to revitalizing the HIV response, since multi-sectoral
and multi-disciplinary work is needed. Munich was also selected as host city to bring a specific focus
on Central and Eastern Europe, including Ukraine and the Russian Federation, where the HIV epidemic
continues to expand, driven by a lack of access to health services for key populations and exacerbated
by the disruption and instability of the war in Ukraine, mass migration and faltering economies.
AIDS 2024 aims to:
1. Accelerate scientific discovery to drive innovation across the HIV prevention and treatment
cascades, including pathogenesis, transmission, co-morbidities, vaccines, and cure; long-acting oral
and injectable treatment and prevention technologies, including rings for prevention; integrated and
differentiated models of care; and analyses of structural and economic determinants of health.
2. Advance core components of implementation science research that address the challenges
and opportunities of implementing novel prevention and treatment modalities in different populations
and contexts, including implementation of long-acting antiretrovirals for prevention and treatment, and
in settings of conflict and displacement.
3. Address HIV vulnerability and determinants of disease progression among key and
vulnerable populations, including novel interventions and implementation science to reduce stigma
and discrimination, including intersectional stigmas of HIV, homophobia, transphobia, and ethnic and
racial disparities.
4. Draw attention to enduring gaps in the HIV response, such as areas where greater investment
is needed in research and person-centered service delivery, and where the needs of communities
remain neglected.
5. Explore complex dynamics of the still expanding HIV epidemic in Central and Eastern
Europe, including structural barriers preventing uptake of services by key and vulnerable populations
and the impact of the war in Ukraine.
The scientific program will consist of six tracks: Track A/Basic and translational research; Track
B/Clinical research; Track C/Epidemiology and prevention research; Track D/Social and behavioral
research; Track E/Implementation research, economics, systems and synergies; and Track F/Political
research, law, policy and human rights. Main topics, challenges and developments to be addressed in
each track are described below. While the scientific program of the conference is developed by
international members of track committees representative of different disciplines and areas of science,
cross-cutting aspects will be covered in plenary talks that also connect the scientific tracks with
community and policy perspectives. Additionally, bridging sessions are designed to cut across at least
two of the scientific tracks to provide opportunities for multi-disciplinary, multi-perspective dialogues. A
particular emphasis will be placed on ensuring interaction between on-site and virtual conference
delegates in Q&A and discussion sessions through the use of advanced conferencing technology.
Access and diversity will remain key guiding principles at AIDS 2024, with large scholarship and youth
programs to strengthen engagement and capacities of the next generation of researchers, clinicians,
educators, and advocates. The conference will be fully hybrid with all conference sessions accessible
online live and on demand.","AIDS 2024, the 25th International AIDS Conference, Munich, Germany, and virtually 22-26 July 2024","Project Narrative
AIDS 2024, the 25th International AIDS Conference, will be held from 22-26 July 2024 in
Munich (Germany) and virtually. With an expected attendance of 15,000 participants, it will be
an essential convening to bring together all stakeholders to review the evidence, debate
course corrections, renew the global consensus that the AIDS crisis is not over and unite the
global HIV response behind an evidence-based approach that puts people first, the theme
chosen for AIDS 2024. Germany offers a compelling location as a center of scientific
excellence and a leader of the HIV response in Europe. The special focus of the conference
on the fast-growing HIV epidemic in Central and Eastern Europe will translate into
implementation science and policy discussions on the challenges of sustaining HIV efforts in
contexts of political neglect, armed conflict and displacement, and a strong involvement of
scientists, policy makers and implementers from the region.",https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10917481,AIDS prevention;Acceleration;Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome;Address;Advocate;Aging;Americas;Anti-Retroviral Agents;Area;Attention;Basic Science;Behavioral Research;COVID-19;Caring;Cessation of life;Cities;Clinical Research;Communities;Complex;Conflict (Psychology);Consensus;Country;Development;Discipline;Discrimination;Disease Progression;Eastern Europe;Economics;Ensure;Epidemic;Europe;Funding;Gays;Gender;Germany;Goals;HIV;HIV Infections;HIV Vaccine Trials Network;HIV vaccine;HIV/AIDS;Health Services Accessibility;Health system;Homophobia;Human;Human Rights;Hybrids;Incidence;Individual;Infection;Infrastructure;Injectable;Injecting drug user;International;International AIDS;Intervention;Investments;Laboratories;Laws;Leadership;Legal;Location;Modality;Modeling;Oral;Participant;Pathogenesis;Personal Satisfaction;Persons;Policies;Policy Maker;Politics;Population;Prevention;Prevention Research;Public Health;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Resources;Scholarship;Science;Scientific Advances and Accomplishments;Scientist;Series;Site;Southern Africa;System;Technology;Thinking;Training;Translating;Translational Research;Tuberculosis;Ukraine;Vaccines;Vulnerable Populations;War;Woman;Work;Youth;antiretroviral therapy;co-infection;comorbidity;cost;design;economic determinant;efficacy trial;epidemiology study;ethnic disparity;evidence base;global health;health determinants;implementation barriers;implementation research;implementation science;innovation;member;men;men who have sex with men;migration;multidisciplinary;neglect;next generation;novel;pandemic disease;person centered;pre-exposure prophylaxis;prevent;programs;racial disparity;response;service delivery;service uptake;sex;social;social stigma;structural determinants;symposium;synergism;transgender;transmission process;transphobia;uptake;virtual,10917481,1R13AI183912-01,,,,,,,,"['aids prevention', 'acceleration', 'acquired immunodeficiency syndrome', 'address', 'advocate', 'aging', 'americas', 'anti-retroviral agents', 'area', 'attention', 'basic science', 'behavioral research', 'covid-19', 'caring', 'cessation of life', 'cities', 'clinical research', 'communities', 'complex', 'conflict (psychology)', 'consensus', 'country', 'development', 'discipline', 'discrimination', 'disease progression', 'eastern europe', 'economics', 'ensure', 'epidemic', 'europe', 'funding', 'gays', 'gender', 'germany', 'goals', 'hiv', 'hiv infections', 'hiv vaccine trials network', 'hiv vaccine', 'hiv/aids', 'health services accessibility', 'health system', 'homophobia', 'human', 'human rights', 'hybrids', 'incidence', 'individual', 'infection', 'infrastructure', 'injectable', 'injecting drug user', 'international', 'international aids', 'intervention', 'investments', 'laboratories', 'laws', 'leadership', 'legal', 'location', 'modality', 'modeling', 'oral', 'participant', 'pathogenesis', 'personal satisfaction', 'persons', 'policies', 'policy maker', 'politics', 'population', 'prevention', 'prevention research', 'public health', 'reporting', 'research', 'research personnel', 'resources', 'scholarship', 'science', 'scientific advances and accomplishments', 'scientist', 'series', 'site', 'southern africa', 'system', 'technology', 'thinking', 'training', 'translating', 'translational research', 'tuberculosis', 'ukraine', 'vaccines', 'vulnerable populations', 'war', 'woman', 'work', 'youth', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'co-infection', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'design', 'economic determinant', 'efficacy trial', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic disparity', 'evidence base', 'global health', 'health determinants', 'implementation barriers', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'innovation', 'member', 'men', 'men who have sex with men', 'migration', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglect', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'person centered', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'prevent', 'programs', 'racial disparity', 'response', 'service delivery', 'service uptake', 'sex', 'social', 'social stigma', 'structural determinants', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'transgender', 'transmission process', 'transphobia', 'uptake', 'virtual']",,
"PROJECT SUMMARY
Biomedical applications in both research and clinical settings rely on microinjection protocols that require using
a hollow microcapillary needle to deliver foreign substances (e.g., nucleic acids, proteins, viruses, cells, and
nanoparticles) directly into biological targets (e.g., cells, embryos, and tissues). This transgenic engineering
technique has driven advances in fundamental research in areas including cell, systems, and developmental
biology, stem cell gene manipulation, and human disease prevention modeling, as well as for medical
applications including in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle therapy, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, and
intraocular injection. However, the industry standard microneedles (ISNs) used for microinjection in research
settings are typically produced lab-by-lab by physically “pulling” apart transparent glass capillary tubes, which
results in needle variability. The inconsistencies can negatively affect experimental rigor, reproducibility,
productivity, and microinjection efficacy. Thus, the ability to enhance and expand the capabilities of the
microneedles that enable microinjection protocols could significantly impact diverse biomedical fields and
applications. We hypothesize that by leveraging well-established “pyrolysis” post-processing strategies for
enhancing the mechanical properties of DLW-printed 3D microstructures, we can achieve mechanically robust
microinjection needles—based on our pending-patented MSP design—that simultaneously address all the pain
points of ISNs. This proposal will systematically evaluate the utility of the mechanically robust 3D-printed
microcapillary needles versus ISNs with regard to key quantitative metrics of performance underlying material
delivery into zebrafish embryos by: 1) establishing and characterizing pyrolysis protocols for DLW-printed 3D
microneedles, 2) Interrogating the mechanical properties of pyrolyzed 3D microneedle prototypes in vitro, and
3) evaluating microinjection efficacy of pyrolyzed DLW-printed 3D microneedle prototypes versus ISNs using
live zebrafish embryos in vivo. These innovative, geometrically sophisticated, functionally advantageous
microneedle with robust mechanically properties hold unique promise to allow for fast, accurate, and consistent
microinjections with minimal damage to injection targets (e.g., embryos).",MECHANICALLY ROBUST 3D-PRINTED MICROCAPILLARY NEEDLES WITH ANTI-CLOGGING CAPABILITIES,"PROJECT NARRATIVE

"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects approximately 14.1 million people in the United States. Despite the
prevalence of this disorder, we lack a thorough understanding of its underlying neurobiological mechanisms.
One of the major mechanisms believed to contribute to the development of AUD is the dysregulation of central
stress systems (Brady & Sonne, 1999). Whereas acute alcohol elevates stress hormones, chronic alcohol intake
results in diminished hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis function characterized by a reduced physiological
response to stress (Stephens & Wand, 2012). Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the
paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVNCRH) are essential for initiating the HPA axis response.
Moreover, PVNCRH neurons and HPA hormones show distinct adaptations to chronic stressors, excessive
alcohol, and withdrawal from alcohol (Bryon Adinoff et al., 2003; Sivukhina et al., 2006). For example, AUD and
abstinence both blunt hormonal HPA axis responses to stress, but basal cortisol production is hyperactive during
acute withdrawal and hypoactive during protracted abstinence(B. Adinoff et al., 1998; Stephens & Wand, 2012).
While much of the field has focused on the role of PVNCRH neurons in initiating the hormonal response to stress,
recent studies have revealed these cells are also critical for stress-linked behaviors that are independent of
stress hormone actions (Kim et al., 2019). These include active defensive behaviors (escape), social approach
and perseverative, grooming behavior. These studies indicate that PVNCRH neurons orchestrate complex
behaviors and highlight new opportunities to probe for how disruptions in local signaling and changes in afferent
drive to PVNCRH neurons following alcohol consumption may affect behavior. In addition, preliminary studies from
the Bains lab have found that PVNCRH neurons can track the valence of contexts over a scale of time that outlasts
behavior. Changes in the activity of these neurons following alcohol exposure may contribute to aberrant patterns
of behavior that drive chronic alcohol consumption. Here, we propose to use a multi-faceted approach integrating
machine learning based behavioral analysis, cell type specific genetic manipulations, in vivo imaging and ex vivo
slice physiology to begin to unravel the role of PVNCRH neurons in alcohol use disorders. We will test the central
hypothesis that alcohol drinking leads to heightened activation of PVNCRH neurons driving persistent increases
in stress behaviors and that PVNCRH neurons play a critical role in alcohol consumption.",Probing Ethanol Dysregulation of Hypothalamic CRH neurons,"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects approximately 14.1 million people in the United States. Despite the

disease and 110 thousand deaths as reported in 2019. Vaccines against S. typhi have been developed,
including Vi polysaccharide vaccine and more recently, Vi conjugate vaccines. They are based on the Vi
polysaccharide of S. typhi which is a linear alpha 1–4 linked polygalacturonic acid (PGA) that is N-acetylated at
C2 and O-acetylated at C3 of the galacturonic acid (Gal UA) residue. The O-acetyl group at C3 is the dominant
determinant of immunogenicity and potency. The Vi conjugate vaccines, overcoming the T-independence of Vi
polysaccharide vaccine, are T-dependent and effective in protection against typhoid fever in people > 6
months. However, because of the high molecular weight of Vi polysaccharide, these conjugate vaccines could
potentially still induce a partial T-independent response and hyporesponsiveness after booster immunization in
people under 2 years. Thus, conjugate vaccines with fragmented or low molecular weight Vi (~50 kDa) are
being developed as the potential fully T-dependent and more effective vaccines.
 Production of Vi vaccines are complex and challenging due to reliance on bacterial fermentation and
processing difficulties and low yield of the Vi polysaccharide. Thus, synthetic Vi polysaccharides have been
generated and evaluated through an extensive series of studies initiated by scientists of NICHD (National
Institute of Child Health and Human Development). It is produced by O-acetylation of plant polygalacturonic
acid (PGA) which shares the same backbone as the Vi polysaccharide and are readily and abundantly
available. The resulting O-acetylated PGA (AcPGA) thus carries the dominant O-acetyl group epitope of Vi
polysaccharide. A phase I clinical trial with a synthetic Vi conjugate vaccine has been successfully conducted
by the NICHD team which showed that it is safe and immunogenic, thus providing a critical clinical proof-of-
concept for the synthetic Vi conjugate vaccine. Such a synthetic vaccine could provide significant advantages
over current Vi conjugate vaccine by eliminating the complex and challenging bacteria-based production
system. However, development of the synthetic Vi vaccines does face a significant challenge of potential
variation of plant PGA raw materials, especially in molecular weight, which in turn could lead to variation in
AcPGA or the synthetic Vi antigen. To overcome this challenge and also produce a more effective T-
dependent synthetic Vi polysaccharide, we have developed a simple and efficient process to generate low
molecular weight (LMW) AcPGA through controlled hydrolysis of AcPGA. The resulting LMW AcPGA has a low
molecular weight of 30-60 kDa and a high degree of O-acetylation (DOAc) which exceeds its specification for
Vi polysaccharide. We have further generated a LMW AcPGA conjugate with a novel nanoparticle carrier
protein (Dps, DNA-binding protein from starved cells) of Salmonella bacteria and showed that it is capable of
generating high titers of anti-Vi polysaccharide antibodies in rabbits, thus demonstrating the feasibility of this
LMW synthetic Vi conjugate vaccine. Based on these promising results, we propose to continue development
of this LMW synthetic Vi conjugate vaccine through two specific aims. Specific aim 1 will focus on generation
and characterization of LMW AcPGA while Specific aim 2 will focus on generation, characterization, and
immunogenicity evaluation of LMW AcPGA-Dps conjugates. The primary goals are to establish the optimal
processes and assays for production and characterization of LWM AcPGA and demonstrate the fully T-
dependent induction of anti-Vi polysaccharide antibodies by the LWM AcPGA-Dps conjugates.
 Successful completion of the proposed studies will demonstrate production of the synthetic Vi antigen
(LMW AcPGA) from plant PGA raw materials and establish the LMW synthetic Vi conjugate vaccine candidate
(LMW AcPGA-Dps). They will form the basis for further development toward cGMP manufacturing
development and clinical studies. Successful development of this LMW synthetic Vi conjugate vaccine could
potentially provide a drastically improved Vi conjugate vaccine which will not only be produced more efficiently
with a higher capacity but could also be more effective by being fully T-dependent with its LMW synthetic Vi
polysaccharide.",Development of a low molecular weight synthetic Vi conjugate vaccine for salmonella typhi,"Project narrative
Salmonella typhi is the major cause of typhoid fever and a significant global health concern. Current conjugate
vaccines for controlling this bacterial pathogen are based on the Vi polysaccharide produced through a
bacteria-based production system with poor yield. This project seeks to develop a low-molecular weight

polysaccharide. This synthetic Vi conjugate will not only be more readily available through its simple and
efficient production process but could also be more effective in protection against this bacterial pathogen.",https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10921336,Acetylation;Acids;Anti-Bacterial Agents;Antibodies;Bacteria;Biological Assay;Carrier Proteins;Cells;Cessation of life;Clinical;Clinical Research;Complex;Conjugate Vaccines;Country;Cyclic GMP;DNA-Binding Proteins;Development;Disease;Epitopes;Evaluation;Face;Fermentation;Future;Generations;Goals;Hydrolysis;India;Link;Modification;Molecular Weight;Mus;National Institute of Child Health and Human Development;Oryctolagus cuniculus;Persons;Phase I Clinical Trials;Plants;Polysaccharides;Process;Production;Proteins;Qualifying;Reporting;Salmonella;Salmonella Vaccines;Salmonella typhi;Scientist;Secondary Immunization;Series;Specific qualifier value;Starvation;Synthetic Vaccines;System;Typhoid Fever;Vaccines;Variant;Vertebral column;Vi antigen;bactericide;clinical development;galacturonic acid;global health;immunogenic;immunogenicity;improved;manufacture;meter;nanoparticle;novel;pathogenic bacteria;preclinical development;response;vaccine candidate,10921336,1R43AI184247-01,typhoid,21,0.98,0.94,tru,,"project narrative

"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Humans have evolved an expanded and elaborated brain capable of higher-order cognition. However, the
sequence variants and resulting neural specializations that distinguish humans from other mammals are
commonly dysregulated in diseases such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This suggests that human-specific
non-coding variants are enriched for neural functions and may underlie genetic and phenotypic disease
vulnerabilities. Thus, there is a critical need to identify and characterize the non-coding variants that underlie
human neural specializations. However, identifying the causal variants that contribute to human neural
specializations is a daunting challenge that has been likened to searching for needles in a haystack. In this
proposal, Dr. Janet Song will improve prioritization of human-specific variants for further functional analysis using
two complementary approaches (Aims 1 and 2) and determine whether prioritized variants regulate nearby gene
expression in a high-throughput manner (Aim 3). Dr. Song will use the human-chimpanzee tetraploid system to
link regulatory regions that are differentially accessible between species to nearby differential genes in neural
progenitor cells and excitatory neurons, two cell types that are profoundly changed in humans and are commonly
dysregulated in neurological diseases (Aim 1 – K99 phase). As a complementary approach, Dr. Song will identify
constrained human-specific insertions and assess their contribution to ASD risk (Aim 2 – K99/R00 phase). Dr.
Song will then evaluate the effects of human-specific variants on nearby gene expression in neural cell types
using CRISPR inhibition screens (Aim 3 – K99/R00 phase).
This K99/R00 proposal will support Dr. Janet Song in her pursuit of the genetic basis of human neural
specializations and allow her to acquire new skills in comparative and functional genomics that will open up
innovative approaches to explore this problem. This proposal will be initiated during the mentored period in Dr.
Christopher Walsh’s lab at Boston Children’s Hospital / Harvard Medical School and continue in Dr. Song’s own
lab upon securing an independent position. In addition to providing immediate insights into the genetic basis of
human neural specializations, the proposed research will lay the foundation for Dr. Song’s independent research
program. It will provide a framework for future studies in additional cell types or paradigms, pinpoint high-priority
loci for single-locus studies, and identify a corpus of human-evolved elements that may contribute to genetic risk
for neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric diseases. Long-term, Dr. Song’s independent research program
will dissect how sequences that changed in humans relative to other mammals result in human-specific neural
phenotypes, and ultimately, contribute to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric diseases.",Genomic approaches to understand human neural specializations,"PROJECT NARRATIVE

This grant is written to request funding to support the 18th International Congress on Combustion
By-Products and their Health Effects, also known as PIC to be held May 20-22nd, 2024 in
Durham, NC. This enduring and small conference provides a unique platform to share the latest
science and exchange ideas across and among a diverse group of researchers from various
fields, including academia, industry, and government officials. The goal of the Congress is to
foster interactions and collaborations in a more narrowly focused research field compared to other
large discipline-specific scientific conferences that have a larger breadth and parallel session
formats. The Congress is held biennially and brings together scholars and researchers from
diverse fields such as chemistry, toxicology, engineering, epidemiology, and occupational and
public health to bear on a variety of issues related to combustion and thermal processes.
Participants are international and hail from academia, government, and industry research groups.
Given the focus on combustion byproducts and health, this Congress has a long-standing
affiliation with the Superfund Research Program (SRP). The SRP has long supported research
on combustion products found at legacy Superfund sites, but also due to natural and accidental
fires that lead to exposure to hazardous chemicals. Due to failing infrastructure, accidental and
transportation fires (e.g. fires associated with train derailments), can significantly impact the local
environment and increase concern about health impacts on the surrounding communities.
Additionally, hazardous materials found at Superfund sites can produce combustion-derived
pollutants that deserve specialized research and investigation that is not normally afforded to the
originally abandoned material. However, for this Congress, combustion is used in the broadest
sense of the word and includes all forms of thermal reactions, even those used to produce energy
or remediate wastes. Thus, it will also include discussions on the generation and health effects of
toxic by-products from other thermal reactions including energy recovery, materials recovery, and
climate change aspects as it pertains to the combustion emission and environmental health.",18th International Congress on Combustion By-Products and their Health Effects,"Project Narrative

"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Pregnancy is a physiological state of continuous and significant adaptation to changing maternal and fetal
nutritional needs ensuring successful completion of pregnancy at term. To this end, as pregnancy progresses,
the placenta produces multiple hormones that participate in modifying maternal metabolism to meet the
metabolic needs of both fetus and mother. Of the placental hormones, circulating kisspeptin1 (Kiss1) levels
progressively increase by several-hundred-fold during pregnancy. Although certain metabolic actions have been
assigned to Kiss1, little is known about how Kiss1 contributes to the metabolic adaptations of pregnancy.
 In addition to developing insulin resistance, maternal hepatic glucose output (rate of appearance) increases
as does the propensity to developing hypoglycemia and ketosis even after short periods of fasting. The
mechanism underlying the tendency of the pregnant female to develop ketosis remains unknown. Further,
insufficient glucose and nutrient supply to the fetus poses a significant health risk for the developing child.
 Based on our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that during gestation placenta-derived circulating Kiss1,
activates its cognate G-protein coupled receptor Kiss1R on hepatocytes and signals via Gaq-inositol
triphosphate receptors (IP3R) to activate AMPK (adenosine-monophosphate dependent kinase), lipolysis and
ketogenesis. Absence of Kiss1R in hepatocytes of female mice during pregnancy leads to excessive lipid
accumulation in maternal hepatocytes and to increased risk of hypoglycemia in the third trimester.
 Furthermore, our preliminary studies indicate that the pancreatic hormone glucagon stimulates hepatic Kiss1
production, whereby Kiss1 acts in the liver in an autocrine manner. Absent liver Kiss1R, glucagon-induced IP3
production as well as hepatic glucose output are blunted in fasting mice, suggesting that kisspeptin induction is
an integral part of glucagon action in hepatocytes. These observations reveal a novel regulatory interplay
between glucagon and Kiss1 in regulating hepatic metabolic pathways.
 We now seek to expand our novel and exciting findings specifically a) to understand the molecular
mechanisms that shape maternal liver metabolism in gestation; b) to understand different Kiss1R-IP3R signaling
pathways in regulating liver metabolism, and c) to understand the role of glucagon-stimulated kisspeptin
production by the liver in modulating liver metabolism during gluconeogenesis.
 We will use complementary in vivo and in vitro approaches to elucidate these important signaling pathways
in hepatocytes using newly generated unique mouse models as well as in vitro in human hepatocyte cell lines.
 Our studies will yield important insights into kisspeptin’s role in liver metabolism during eutherian pregnancy
and into how kisspeptin and glucagon signaling interplay in hepatocytes to regulate metabolism. Further, our
studies will dissect signaling pathways as potential therapeutic targets in metabolic liver disease and diabetes
mellitus.",The Role of Kisspeptin in Metabolism Regulation,"PROJECT NARRATIVE

"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Diabetes is a costly and complex chronic illness and a serious public health problem.
The number of individuals with diabetes, particularly obesity-linked type 2 diabetes (T2D), is certain to increase
over the next decades. Shockingly, the children of today have an estimated overall lifetime risk of developing
diabetes of nearly 50%. Therefore, developing new methods to prevent T2D and properly treat T2D patients is
exceptionally timely and of great significance. The progression to T2D is increasingly being linked with changes
in cellular and molecular signaling pathways in the insulin-secreting pancreatic β-cell, preventing adequate
insulin secretion to stimulate the body’s cells to take up glucose from the blood. Yet, few T2D drugs specifically
target the β-cell, and those that do are not effective in all individuals and are controversially linked with β-cell
failure long-term. Two molecules that are cornerstones of our research program are prostaglandin EP3 receptor
(EP3), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) for the arachidonic acid metabolite, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and
its associated G protein alpha subunit, Gαz. Work from our group and others has definitively shown EP3
expression and signaling is increased in β-cells of T2D mice and human organ donors and blocking EP3 signaling
can stimulate β-cell insulin secretion and proliferation. These exciting results suggest targeting EP3 and/or Gαz
might increase the number of functional β-cells in T2D; yet, much more work is necessary to achieve this. Our
long-term goal is to fully characterize the EP3 and Gαz activation and signaling pathways during the progression
to T2D at the whole body, tissue, cellular, and molecular levels, providing us key information on how to target
this β-cell pathway in T2D. The overall objective of this work, which is the next logical step in pursuit of our goal,
is to define the molecular signaling pathways responsible for the impact of EP3 signaling, both Gɑz-dependent
and -independent, on mouse and human β-cell compensation and β-cell failure. Our central hypothesis is EP3
and Gαz, when active, modulate intracellular signaling pathways critical for β-cell compensation in obesity but,
when chronically active, contribute to β-cell dysfunction and loss in T2D. We will test our central hypothesis with
a combination of innovative cellular imaging, metabolomics, and proteomics assays, correlating changes in EP3
and Gɑz signaling pathways with measurements of β-cell function in response to glucose and glucagon-like
peptide 1: a well-accepted class of T2D drugs. We will accomplish this goal by pursuing the following three
Specific Aims: 1. Determine effects of EP3 on discrete cellular pools of β-cell Ca2+ and cAMP and
downstream β-cell function and mass; 2. Quantify Gɑz-dependent Rap1GAP translocation, Rap1GAP
phosphorylation, and their effects on β-cell function and mass; and 3. Quantify changes in the human
islet arachidonic acid metabolome, and the functional consequence of these changes, during the
progression to T2D. This work, when completed, will provide a much more complete understanding of the role
of the β-cell and its signaling molecules in the progression to and pathophysiology of T2D.",The role of G protein-dependent and -independent EP3 signaling in beta-cell compensation and diabetes,"Project Narrative
Type 2 diabetes is a costly and complex chronic illness and a serious public health problem, responsible for a
host of complications that significantly decrease healthy lifespan. The underlying issue in diabetes is the failure
of specific cells in the pancreas, termed β-cells, to release enough of the hormone, insulin, into the bloodstream

"PROJECT SUMMARY
Animals can modulate learning in response to differing internal and external environments. Layering context
onto learned information can enhance the diversity and specificity of memories, and can allow efficient access
to situation-specific behaviors. In state-dependent learning (SDL), information learned by an animal while it is
in a particular internal “state” is most effectively recalled when the animal is tested in the same internal state.
Drug intoxication-induced SDL can be observed across diverse animal species, including humans. We will
employ a model of ethanol intoxication-induced SDL that we have developed in the nematode Caenorhabditis
elegans to define the molecular mechanisms that are required for SDL to occur. The simple and highly
conserved nervous system of C. elegans provides an excellent model in which to study the molecular events
that underlie SDL. When worms experience an attractive olfactory cue in the absence of food, they can learn to
associate the odorant with starvation and attenuate their response to it in a process called olfactory learning
(OL). We have shown that OL can become state-dependent; when animals undergo OL while they are
intoxicated, they only express the learned behavior when they are tested in the same intoxicated state. We
have shown that the internal intoxication state is encoded by a secreted peptide signal and its receptor during
OL, but, surprisingly, this signal does not encode intoxication state during recall of OL. Here, we will identify the
mechanisms by which state is encoded during recall of state-dependent OL. We will define the neural circuit in
which SDL occurs and the inputs into it that signal state during both learning and recall. We will distinguish
between two explanations for the lack of expression of state-dependent OL when the animals are tested in a
non-intoxicated state: forgetting (loss of the learned information) or failing to recall (the learned information
remains, but the memory is only accessible when the animals are intoxicated). We will determine if other drugs
besides ethanol can confer state-dependency on OL. Finally, we will probe the generalizability of SDL beyond
OL by asking if learning paradigms that use other neural circuits and signaling systems can become state
dependent. Successful completion of these aims will provide novel molecular insight into how context cues are
added to learned information.",State-dependent modulation of learning,"PROJECT NARRATIVE

"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Microbial biofilm infections are a leading complication in healing of wounds arising in a multitude of settings,
including severe burns, non-healing pressure ulcers, dog bites, surgical site infections, and gunshot wounds.
Infection impairs the wound healing process and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. A recent
meta-analysis indicates that the prevalence of biofilms in chronic non-healing wounds is 78% [1]. Biofilm
formation imparts resistance to antibiotics through innate resistance factors including the drug diffusion barrier
of the biofilm's extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and through induced changes in gene expression, cell
signaling and metabolism. Significant correlations have been demonstrated between biofilm formation and
multi-drug resistance (MDR) in diverse clinical isolates from wounds [2]. An additional complication is that
biofilm formation and progression are not visible to the naked eye; as a result, biofilm infections are not
discerned until they are well established and recalcitrant to treatment.
A key barrier to identification and treatment of biofilm infections is penetration of their EPS in order for an
imaging contrast agent or therapeutic to reach the infecting bacteria. Penetration of biofilms by surfactants,
primarily through detergency and surface energy modifications that inhibit bacterial adhesion, may offer a
solution to this problem. Strong surfactants such as Tween 20 and Triton X-100 have been shown to disperse
biofilms but are too cytotoxic for systemic clinical applications. Polymeric surfactants such as poly(acrylic acid)
polyelectrolyte, Carbopol 934TM, and poly(alkylene oxide), Poloxamer 407TM, inhibit biofilm formation but are
non-specific and are not strongly antimicrobial [3].
We have recently developed novel graft polyelectrolyte surfactants (PS) that combine the functionalities of these
previously used materials with the ability to encapsulate into nanoparticles and deliver cationic antimicrobials
(CAMs), with the result being enhanced activity against biofilms in vitro. We propose that such PS can be
employed in the wound infection environment, both for imaging and for treatment, by formulation into a
“nanospray” that is able to achieve broad coverage within the wound bed, avoid rapid clearance of dyes or of
active CAMs in the highly active regenerating wound environment, and penetrate biofilm barriers via the
polyelectrolyte surfactant detergency. In order to test this hypothesis, we will: (1) expand the repertoire of CAMs
that can achieve favorable nanoformulation with the PS; (2) evaluate the ability of nanospray PS-CAM
formulations to treat biofilms in vitro and in vivo; and (3) develop and evaluate the ability of PS-CAM-ICG (where
ICG = indocyanine green) formulations to image biofilm formation.",Nanospray treatment of biofilm infections in wounds,"PROJECT NARRATIVE

"Project Summary/Abstract
“The Virus Structure and Assembly Conference” is the premier international meeting for structural virology,
attracting hundreds of researchers at every career level from around the world. Organized as part of the FASEB
Science Research Conference series, it has been running biennially since 1990. The Conference covers a broad
range of bacterial and eukaryotic viruses, with an initial focus on virus structure and assembly pathways,
mechanisms of virus entry, virus-host interactions, and viral replication, recently expanded to encompass viral
genomics and evolution, therapeutics, vaccines, and nanotechnological applications. A unique feature of the
Virus Structure and Assembly Conference has been the ability to merge and integrate tremendous advances in
biophysical studies of viruses with functional aspects of virus biology. Fueled by the cryo-electron microscopy
revolution, the FASEB meeting has brought together structural biologists, virologists, and microbiologists,
promoting interactions and guiding young researchers to embrace studies on viruses. The broad focus on virus
systems studied from different angles encourages inter-disciplinary approaches, stimulates collaborations, and
supports the rapid transfer of technology, overcoming silos and roadblocks of more topic-focused conferences.
To maintain its legacy of scientific innovation in virology, our program includes top investigators in all areas of
structural virology from around the world, more than one-third of whom are new to the Conference. For 2024,
we will strengthen the focus on pandemic readiness with ample exposure to RNA viruses such as HIV-1,
Influenza, and SARS-CoV-2.
 A vital aspect of the FASEB Virus Structure and Assembly Conference pedigree is the focus on mentoring
and training sessions that we achieve through extensive small-group activities between senior and junior
researchers. Scientific discussions with speakers and among participants are vital to encourage the flow of new
ideas and new collaborations, expanding the base and bringing new scientists to the Conference. In 2024, we
will have feature daily “Meet the Expert” sessions as well as “Meet the Sponsor” and “Flash Talk” sessions for
graduate students to present posters selected by our judges for 15-minute platform talks. A rich “Career
Development Workshop” will be offered to early-stage researchers with guests from academia, the private sector,
and government agencies, who will present, compare and contrast alternative career paths in science. All
sessions will keep a strong focus on women and underrepresented groups in science, creating awareness and
promoting scientific inclusiveness. Robust fundraising primarily made possible by our super-sponsor Thermo
Scientific and support through this NIH R13 will allow us to offer travel scholarships to an unprecedented number
of graduate students, postdocs, and early-stage researchers. While continuing the tradition of top-quality FASEB
meetings, the 2024 Virus Structure and Assembly Conference will also substantially attempt to enlarge the
scientific base and promote the participation of underrepresented scientists.",Virus Structure and Assembly,"Project Narrative

"PROJECT SUMMARY
Inhalation of airborne particles, especially fine and ultrafine particulate matter (PM) can lead to pulmonary
inflammation, which if not resolved, can cause lung injury and subsequent development of several chronic
diseases. Pulmonary cells release signaling molecules to orchestrate inflammatory responses via cell-cell
communication. One of the essential cell-cell communication mechanisms is via extracellular vesicles (EVs)
and their enclosed cargoes (e.g. microRNAs). Compared to the extracellular signaling molecules, EVs carry
the advantages of protecting the messengers better with their membrane structures and enhancing their effective
concentrations within the vesicular compartment. Thus, identifying the key EV populations responsible for
inflammation regulation and even resolution could greatly help development of therapeutics to alleviate the
damage from the airborne particle-induced inflammation. However, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact types of
EVs and their cargos responsible for inflammation resolution. We hypothesize that by tracing the EVs derived
from pulmonary cells with the special focus on exosomes (Exos) at various time points during inflammation
development, we can identify the specific EV sub-groups responsible for inflammation resolution. Hence, we
proposed to identify Exos and their miRNA cargos in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung tissue
in acute and sub-chronic models of pulmonary inflammation (Aim1) and employ NanOstirBar-EnabLed
Single EV Analysis (NOBEL-SEA) to analyze cell specific Exos and enclosed miRNAs (Aim 2). NOBEL-
SEA is a highly innovative advanced analytical technique developed in Dr. Zhong’s group. This technique
enables detection of single EVs and their enclosed miRNA cargos with low sample consumption, high sensitivity
and specificity, and short turn-around time. We will examine the kinetic secretion profiles of Exos in two
inflammation models induced by two nanoparticles that have shown in our previous work to cause either
resolving or persistent inflammation. We will first profile miRNAs from isolated exosomes in BAL fluid and lung
tissue and then apply NOBEL-SEA for analyses of cell-specific Exos and miRNAs. Utilizing two inflammation
models will allow us to study differences in Exos and miRNAs secretion during inflammation initiation and
resolution. Monitoring the dynamic of Exo secretion from different cells and revealing their enclosed miRNAs will
help achieve better understanding on how this EV subtype mediates communication between pulmonary cells
and contributes to the transformation from pro- to anti-inflammatory states. It will pave the way for our long-term
goals in exploring the functions of EVs for alleviation of inflammatory lung diseases induced by exposure to
ultrafine airborne particles.",The Role of Extracellular Vesicles in Pulmonary Inflammation,"Project Narrative
Chronic exposure to airborne particles could lead to debilitating pulmonary inflammation and subsequent
development of several chronic diseases, making it important to develop new strategies to resolve lung
inflammation and prevent disease development. We propose to study the kinetic production of extracellular
vesicles (EV) and their miRNAs cargos in the lung after particle exposure using an advanced analytical system
to gain better understanding of how EV can mediate cell-cell communication and contribute to inflammation
resolution. Our exploratory work can help reveal the potential roles of the EVs derived from selected pulmonary
cells in anti-inflammation, immunomodulation, and/or airway epithelium protection, which could be leveraged for
developing effective tools to reduce the burden of chronic airway inflammatory diseases.",https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10790710,Acute;Air Pollution;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Asthma;Biological Models;Bronchoalveolar Lavage;Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid;Cell Communication;Cell secretion;Cells;Chronic;Chronic Disease;Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease;Communication;Consumption;Detection;Development;Disease;Environment;Environmental Hazards;Epithelial Cells;Epithelium;Exposure to;Extracellular Space;Flow Cytometry;Future;Gene Expression;Goals;Heterogeneity;Immune;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Response;Inhalation;Kinetics;Knowledge;Lipids;Lung;Macrophage;Mediating;Membrane;MicroRNAs;Modeling;Monitor;Mus;Nucleic Acids;Particulate Matter;Phase;Population;Production;Proteins;Pulmonary Inflammation;Regulation;Resolution;Respiratory Disease;Role;Sampling;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signaling Molecule;Smoking;Source;Stimulus;Structure of parenchyma of lung;Subgroup;System;Techniques;Time;Ultrafine;Vesicle;Work;advanced analytics;airway epithelium;analytical tool;cell type;chemokine;chronic respiratory disease;cytokine;exosome;extracellular;extracellular vesicles;fine particles;immunoregulation;inflammatory lung disease;innovation;lung injury;nanoparticle;neutrophil;particle;particle exposure;prevent;response;success;therapeutic development;tool;treatment strategy;ultrafine particle;vesicular release,10790710,1R21ES035983-01,,,,,,,,"['acute', 'air pollution', 'anti-inflammatory agents', 'asthma', 'biological models', 'bronchoalveolar lavage', 'bronchoalveolar lavage fluid', 'cell communication', 'cell secretion', 'cells', 'chronic', 'chronic disease', 'chronic obstructive pulmonary disease', 'communication', 'consumption', 'detection', 'development', 'disease', 'environment', 'environmental hazards', 'epithelial cells', 'epithelium', 'exposure to', 'extracellular space', 'flow cytometry', 'future', 'gene expression', 'goals', 'heterogeneity', 'immune', 'inflammation', 'inflammatory', 'inflammatory response', 'inhalation', 'kinetics', 'knowledge', 'lipids', 'lung', 'macrophage', 'mediating', 'membrane', 'micrornas', 'modeling', 'monitor', 'mus', 'nucleic acids', 'particulate matter', 'phase', 'population', 'production', 'proteins', 'pulmonary inflammation', 'regulation', 'resolution', 'respiratory disease', 'role', 'sampling', 'sensitivity and specificity', 'signaling molecule', 'smoking', 'source', 'stimulus', 'structure of parenchyma of lung', 'subgroup', 'system', 'techniques', 'time', 'ultrafine', 'vesicle', 'work', 'advanced analytics', 'airway epithelium', 'analytical tool', 'cell type', 'chemokine', 'chronic respiratory disease', 'cytokine', 'exosome', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fine particles', 'immunoregulation', 'inflammatory lung disease', 'innovation', 'lung injury', 'nanoparticle', 'neutrophil', 'particle', 'particle exposure', 'prevent', 'response', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'ultrafine particle', 'vesicular release']",,
"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The long-term goal of this project is to develop a novel mechanistic framework to understand how post-stroke
rehabilitative training modulates neural reorganization in sensorimotor brain regions, and whether such
reorganization is associated with recovery of motor function. In a non-human primate model of capsular stroke,
we will describe the time course of changes in task-related motor encoding and mesoscale cortico-cortical
connectivity that occur in sensorimotor brain regions, and the time course of these changes in relation to motor
recovery. These neurophysiological changes will be compared to those occurring in animals undergoing
intensive rehabilitation initiated in the sub-acute stage after injury. Post-stroke neural plasticity has been
demonstrated repeatedly in pre-clinical and clinical studies. Animal studies have provided key information
regarding the molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity, and focal cortical stroke models have demonstrated
that alterations in neuronal connectivity are correlated with functional recovery. However, most studies are cross-
sectional and cannot address the complex temporal relationships between neural plasticity and behavioral
recovery; conclusions about the impact of rehabilitation on recovery mechanisms, and ultimately on clinical
recovery, are largely correlative. As a result, it is currently unknown whether plasticity mechanisms demonstrated
in most clinical and preclinical studies are associated with the initiation of recovery processes or are the result
of behavioral recovery. Further, when longitudinal studies in clinical populations have been done, relationships
between plasticity and motor recovery have been equivocal, in part because fMRI-based approaches lack the
temporal specificity to resolve the intricate patterns of communication among brain regions that are essential for
normal sensorimotor function. Using chronic microelectrode arrays in a longitudinal experimental design, we will
address three specific aims that examine neural activity (extracellular spikes) simultaneously recorded from
multiple cortical sensorimotor areas and motor thalamus before and after capsular infarct. This will allow us to
examine how stroke-like injuries disrupt task-related motor encoding in somatosensory and motor cortical areas
using traditional dynamical structure models (Aim 1). Further, we will characterize the impact of capsular infarcts
on mesoscale effective connectivity using a novel neurophysiological approach that we recently developed (Aim
2). Finally, we will determine whether rehabilitative training procedures initiated in the sub-acute period after
neural injury influence recovery by modulating task-related activity, altering effective connectivity, or both (Aim
3). The novelty and potential impact of this project stems from the unique longitudinal design, providing us with
the ability to plot the precise temporal profile of local and networked changes to determine if a particular
biomarker precedes rehabilitation-aided recovery, and thus, is more likely to have a direct causal relationship
with functional restoration. Achieving these goals ultimately will inform clinical studies aimed at personalizing
post-stroke rehabilitation based on neurophysiological biomarkers of recovery potential.",Impact of post-stroke rehabilitation on neurophysiological dynamics,"PROJECT NARRATIVE
The proposed research is relevant to public health because brain injuries, such as occur in stroke, leave many
people with chronic motor disabilities, requiring long-term medical and institutional care. This project seeks to
develop a greater understanding of the plasticity process that occurs after brain injury, specifically in the
compensatory functional connections that form in uninjured regions of the brain. Information gained from this
project will inform the development of new therapies, such as rehabilitative approaches designed to maximize
functional recovery after brain injury.",https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10803729,Activities of Daily Living;Acute;Address;Animals;Area;Behavioral;Biological Markers;Brain Injuries;Brain region;Caring;Cerebral cortex;Chronic;Clinical;Clinical Research;Communication;Compensation;Complex;Cross-Sectional Studies;Data;Development;Experimental Designs;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Goals;Heterogeneity;Implant;Individual;Infarction;Injury;Institution;Internal Capsule;Intervention;Learning;Lesion;Limb structure;Longitudinal Studies;Maps;Medical;Microelectrodes;Modeling;Molecular;Monkeys;Motivation;Motor;Motor Cortex;Motor Skills;Motor disability;Movement;Necrosis;Neuroanatomy;Neuronal Plasticity;Neurons;Pattern;Persons;Phase;Population;Procedures;Process;Protocols documentation;Public Health;Recovery;Recovery of Function;Rehabilitation therapy;Research;Research Design;Sensorimotor functions;Shapes;Site;Somatosensory Cortex;Specificity;Stimulus;Stratification;Stroke;Structure;Subcortical Infarctions;Synaptic plasticity;Task Performances;Techniques;Thalamic structure;Time;Training;United States;clinically relevant;cohort;constraint induced movement therapy;design;extracellular;functional restoration;improved;improved outcome;innovation;kinematics;longitudinal design;motor function recovery;motor impairment;motor recovery;multi-electrode arrays;nerve injury;neural;neurophysiology;nonhuman primate;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;post stroke;pre-clinical;preclinical study;response;restoration;signal processing;skills;software development;somatosensory;stem;stroke model;stroke rehabilitation;stroke-like episode;temporal measurement;tractography,10803729,1R01NS131466-01A1,,,,,,,,"['activities of daily living', 'acute', 'address', 'animals', 'area', 'behavioral', 'biological markers', 'brain injuries', 'brain region', 'caring', 'cerebral cortex', 'chronic', 'clinical', 'clinical research', 'communication', 'compensation', 'complex', 'cross-sectional studies', 'data', 'development', 'experimental designs', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging', 'goals', 'heterogeneity', 'implant', 'individual', 'infarction', 'injury', 'institution', 'internal capsule', 'intervention', 'learning', 'lesion', 'limb structure', 'longitudinal studies', 'maps', 'medical', 'microelectrodes', 'modeling', 'molecular', 'monkeys', 'motivation', 'motor', 'motor cortex', 'motor skills', 'motor disability', 'movement', 'necrosis', 'neuroanatomy', 'neuronal plasticity', 'neurons', 'pattern', 'persons', 'phase', 'population', 'procedures', 'process', 'protocols documentation', 'public health', 'recovery', 'recovery of function', 'rehabilitation therapy', 'research', 'research design', 'sensorimotor functions', 'shapes', 'site', 'somatosensory cortex', 'specificity', 'stimulus', 'stratification', 'stroke', 'structure', 'subcortical infarctions', 'synaptic plasticity', 'task performances', 'techniques', 'thalamic structure', 'time', 'training', 'united states', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'constraint induced movement therapy', 'design', 'extracellular', 'functional restoration', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'longitudinal design', 'motor function recovery', 'motor impairment', 'motor recovery', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'nerve injury', 'neural', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'post stroke', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'response', 'restoration', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'software development', 'somatosensory', 'stem', 'stroke model', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke-like episode', 'temporal measurement', 'tractography']",,

than 30,000 Americans at a cost of $5.6 billion annually. Even survivors with a good outcome on common
outcome scales suffer from persistent cognitive deficits. The disease affects younger people and leads to a
disproportionate loss of work-years compared to other forms of stroke. Cognitive deficits in survivors of SAH are
a major driver of the inability to return to work; however, the factors leading to cognitive deficits—and the question
of whether they can be prevented or reversed—are largely unknown. Studies using fMRI and
magnetoencephalography suggest that these cognitive deficits are associated with alterations in resting state
functional brain connectivity, an indicator of long-range neuronal network integrity.
Our group has recently observed that SAH leads to alternations in resting state functional connectivity and
behavior in a mouse model of the disease. We hypothesize that these resting state networks could serve as a
therapeutic target, independent of other kinds of additional underlying mechanisms (e.g., inflammatory, vascular,
cellular, molecular). If we can intervene on these functional networks, then it might be possible to restore normal
cognition after brain injury. We will test our hypothesis through the following aims:
In Aim 1, we will determine the effect of SAH on functional connectivity and behavior. In Aim 2, we will determine
the effect of SAH on structural connectivity. In Aim 3, we will determine the effect of brain stimulation on functional
connectivity and cognition. To accomplish the aims, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team to determine
potential mechanisms of neurocognitive deficits after SAH that includes expertise in the clinical management of
SAH, preclinical mouse models of SAH, in vivo functional optical imaging, mouse MRI, and neuronal circuit
manipulation with optogenetics and chemogenetics.
The ultimate goal of this proposal is to improve cognitive deficits in survivors of aneurysm rupture. Regardless
of our findings, we will gain an understanding of the role of functional networks in cognition following aneurysm
rupture. Our hope is that intervening on these networks can lead to an effective therapy. If we are successful,
we will lay the groundwork for a cure towards neurocognitive decline following subarachnoid hemorrhage while
also contributing to a deeper understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underlying cognition.",Brain Stimulation to Improve Neurocognitive Deficits After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage,"PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE

"Project Summary
PACS2 syndrome is a recently identified neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a recurrent de novo missense
mutation in PACS2 (p.Glu209Lys (PACS2E209K)). Patients carrying this missense mutation suffer from
developmental and epileptic encephalopathy-66 (DEE66), and share several deficits, including neonatal seizures,
global developmental delay, hypotonia, autism, and cerebellar dysgenesis. The mechanism by which
PACS2E209K causes PACS2 syndrome is unknown, and no curative treatment is available. PACS2 is a
multifunctional sorting protein that is essential for formation of ER-mitochondria contacts (MAMs), and localizes
calcium signaling molecules to the ER, including the calcium-permeable channel PKD2. MAMs are dynamic
quasi-synaptic structures that localize mTORC2/Akt, which phosphorylates PACS2 to modulate calcium transfer
and lipid metabolism. MAM-localized PACS2 acts as a phosphorylation state-dependent metabolic switch that
coordinates SIRT1/PGC-1α-dependent oxidative metabolism with MAM integrity and function. The E209K
substitution is located in a critical autoregulatory domain that controls binding of PACS2 to its client proteins.
Preliminary studies suggest PACS2 interacts with PKD2 to mediate ER-mitochondria calcium transfer and that
the E209K substitution reduces MAM contacts and diverts calcium into the cytosol. Consequently, PACS2E209K
increases aerobic glycolysis in both patient cells and the cortex of Pacs2E209K/+ mice. Consistent with these
findings, preliminary electrophysiology studies reveal PACS2E209K increases glutamatergic synaptic inputs in L2/3
cortical neurons. Together, these findings suggest PACS2E209K disturbs MAM function, impacting neuronal
metabolism, neurotransmission, and behavior. Our long-term goal is to understand how PACS2E209K causes
disease and to use this information to develop effective therapies. The objective of this particular application is
to determine how PACS2E209K dysregulates ER-mitochondrial calcium transfer to disturb CNS metabolism and
behavior. We hypothesize that PACS2E209K disturbs PKD2 function to dysregulate MAM integrity and calcium
diffusion dynamics, which consequently switches the brain to glycolytic metabolism and dysregulates
neurotransmission resulting in behavioral deficits. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will test our hypothesis
by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine how PACS2E209K alters ER-mitochondria calcium coupling in
isolated neurons and ex vivo L2/3 slice cultures, 2) Determine the impact of PACS2E209K on fuel handling by
measuring glucose and lactate dynamics, mitochondrial metabolism and gene expression, and 3) Determine
how PACS2E209K alters synaptic activity, learning and behavior. The approach is innovative because we will
combine advanced live-cell imaging with metabolic profiling and behavioral assessments of the first mouse
model for PACS2 syndrome to elucidate the mechanism by which the recurrent E209K substitution causes
neuronal dysfunction. This research is significant because it will advance our mechanistic understanding of a
critical cellular process that might be targeted to treat this debilitating disorder.",Impact of the E209K PACS2 Syndrome mutation on neuronal metabolism and neurotransmission.,"Project Narrative

"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Pain, often referred to as the “fifth vital sign,” is a universal experience and a major reason to seek medical
intervention. Growing evidence indicates a regulatory role of our biological timer, the circadian clock, in pain
timing and thresholds. Particularly, several headache disorders have been found to display distinct circadian
features, including cluster headache (CH) and migraine. CH is an extremely painful disorder (nicknamed “suicide
headache”), affecting 1 out of every 1,000 people, and is known to exhibit a precise daily rhythmicity of headache
attacks. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying rhythmic pain responses in headache disorders remain
poorly understood. This significant gap in knowledge hinders the development of novel chronotherapeutic
strategies to optimize pain management. To elucidate the circadian regulation of pain responses, we first
examined the trigeminal ganglion (TG), the primary somatosensory ganglion for the canonical headache
pathway, and discovered strong circadian rhythms in TG ex vivo cultures. Using a nitroglycerin (NTG) induced
mouse headache model, we demonstrated circadian rhythms of pain sensitivity which were abolished when the
core clock genes Per1/Per2 were disrupted. TG RNA-sequencing analysis revealed a robust circadian
transcriptome including core clock genes and clock-regulated pain neurotransmitters. Among the most
rhythmically expressed genes in the TG circadian transcriptome, Mertk (MER proto-oncogene, tyrosine receptor
kinase) was recently identified as a CH susceptibility gene in three independent large-scale GWAS studies;
however, its role in pain pathways is completely unknown. We found that NTG induced the phosphorylation of
MERTK (which is required for its tyrosine kinase activity), and importantly circadian pain sensitivity was abolished
in Mertk KO mice, suggesting a role for Mertk to confer circadian timing to pain pathways. Based on these
exciting preliminary findings, we hypothesize that the TG circadian clock governs rhythmic headache responses
via regulation of pain genes including the novel regulator Mertk. Our two specific aims are as follows. In Aim 1,
combining genetic, environmental and pharmacological approaches, we will delineate the regulatory role of the
nociceptive neuron clock in headache pain rhythms and a potential chronotherapeutic application. In Aim 2, we
will investigate the role of MERTK in rhythmic headache responses and identify downstream mechanistic
pathways. This grant proposal embodies conceptual and experimental innovations including circadian regulation
of headache pain and a novel regulatory role of MERTK in the clock-headache crosstalk. With the unique
combination of complementary expertise in circadian biology and headache/CH, we are ideally suited to
interrogate key molecular mechanisms at the interface of circadian rhythms and headache pain. Given the
increasing appreciation of the fundamental function of the clock in pain pathophysiology, our study will have
strong basic and translational impact, and may ultimately lead to a new paradigm of manipulating the circadian
machinery to ameliorate headache pain.",Regulation of headache pain responses by the Trigeminal ganglion clock,"PROJECT NARRATIVE

"Abstract:
 Heart failure (HF) is an expanding health problem, affecting >6.2M Americans, causing >80K deaths and
>800K hospitalizations annually, and costing >$30B each year. HF is genetically complex as there are single-
gene Mendelian (one mutation → causes disease) and disease susceptibility (several variants → influence risk
of disease) models. The broad, long-term objective of our project is to use an integrated analysis approach to
precisely quantify the contributions of rare Mendelian and more common disease susceptibility variants
in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Our project is responding to NOT-HL-23-067 (reissue of NOT-HL-21-017),
Integrated Omics Analysis of NHLBI TOPMed Data, and targets the following key knowledge gaps: 1) how do
rare Mendelian-disease and common complex-risk gene HF variants overlap and interact in the pathogenesis of
HF, 2) which complex risk-variants are most likely to be functional (i.e. manifest specific biological mechanisms),
and 3) what additional HF genes remain to be discovered (~50% of genetic HF lacks a pathogenic variant(s)).
 Our approach will leverage a unique whole-genome and whole-transcriptome human heart NHLBI-
sequenced TOPMed dataset (~750 paired DNA/RNA sequenced human samples) using an integrated analysis
approach to dissect the intersection of Mendelian and complex genes and variants. Building on these resources
and approaches we will 1) validate which HR GWAS variants actually affect gene expression in the human heart,
2) discover novel human heart expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) from the cardiac transcriptome in health
and disease, and 3) discover novel HR genes and pathways. Our hypotheses are 1) a subset of published
GWAS HR variants exert direct eQTL mechanistic effects on gene expression in human cardiac tissue, 2) key
genes and pathways of the HR transcriptome are mediated by novel genetic variants that have heretofore not
been identified by GWAS approaches, and 3) integration of published Mendelian and GWAS HR variants in
combination with cardiac tissue eQTL variants will reveal important, novel HR genes.
 Three Specific Aims to test these hypotheses are: 1) Map and validate published GWAS findings onto
the human cardiac transcriptome, 2) Discover novel eQTL DNA variants from HR transcriptomes, and 3)
Discover novel HR genes and perform functional validation studies in human heart tissue and hiPSC-

"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Membrane voltage plays a vital role in transmitting information in the brain: neurons regulate their membrane voltage to
communicate and process information, while irregular neuronal voltage dynamics are associated with several neurological
disorders. Therefore, tools for recording voltage signals are crucial for studying brain computations in both healthy and
diseased states. Genetically Encoded Voltage Indicators (GEVIs) —fluorescent proteins whose brightness is modulated by
voltage— have been recognized for many years as promising tools with enabling features for neuroscience applications,
including high spatiotemporal resolution and cell type specificity. Particularly sought after are GEVIs that perform well
under two-photon (2P) microscopy, the method of choice for imaging neural activity in highly scattering tissue such as the
rodent brain. We have recently demonstrated that the GFP-based indicator JEDI-2P enables sustained (> 30 min), fast (> 1
kHz), and deep-tissue (400 µm or deeper) monitoring of voltage dynamics in individual neuronal somas in awake behaving
mice. However, JEDI-2P and other green GEVIs are spectrally incompatible with optogenetic tools and the best-performing
calcium and neurotransmitter indicators. Red GEVIs have been developed but cannot report spikes under two-photon
microscopy in vivo. The goal of this proposal is thus to address this technology gap and develop red-shifted voltage
indicators for robust 2P imaging in vivo in combination with optogenetics or green indicators of voltage or other modalities.
We propose several complementary but independent approaches to achieve our goal. In Aims 1 and 2, we propose to conduct
two-photon high-throughput screening of indicators repurposing two different classes of fluorescent domains. In Aim 3, we
propose experimental (higher-throughput screening) and computational approaches to accelerate screening and potentiate
the other Aims. We anticipate that this project will produce red GEVIs that enable robust two-photon recordings of spikes
and subthreshold depolarizations in awake behaving animals. We will also optimize and demonstrate approaches to perform
two-photon all-optical physiology and multi-spectral imaging. These new sensors and methods will allow the neuroscience
community to ask questions that are currently technically infeasible, paving the way for a more detailed understanding of
brain computations and how neuronal functional connections are established and modulated during development, learning,
and aging.",Red-shifted voltage indicators for two-photon all-optical physiology and multi-spectral imaging,"NARRATIVE

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic degenerative cell disease characterized by hyperglycemia due to
progressive progressive loss of overworked pancreatic islet beta cells. Recent work from our laboratories has
shown that hyperactivation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) to ER stress in beta cells due to upstream
may be a critical early event in the development of T2D. We have developed and are refining novel small
molecule pharmacological reagents that allow us to manipulate critical components of the UPR—called KIRAs
that maintain desirable (adaptive) outputs of the UPR while quelling undesirable (maladaptive) outputs
including insulin resistance in peripheral tissues, consequently leading to apoptosis and diabetes. We show
that first generation versions of KIRAs we developed against a kinase/RNase target called IRE1α can

"ABSTRACT
 Patients whose lives have been permanently altered by limb loss are currently left with prosthetic
options for restoration of function, but these are not perfect. Prostheses are limited in sensation, articulation,
and integration, among other concerns. Complete restoration of the lost limb via therapeutic intervention
remains a distant goal of regenerative medicine. This goal would be made significantly more tangible if a clear
roadmap for how complex tetrapod limbs can be regenerated was elucidated. Such a roadmap would detail
possible sources of progenitor cells and the cues that activate them to proliferate as well as instructions for
how these substrate cells undergo the changes necessary for them to be competent to build a new limb and to
do so with morphological precision. Since humans, mice, and other mammals do not naturally regenerate full
limbs, the roadmap is not likely to arise from mammalian studies alone. However, salamanders, such as
axolotls, are profoundly regenerative and can completely replace amputated limbs with precision throughout
life, and, with experimentation, they thus offer a chance to build this roadmap.
 How processes that operate at the whole-body, systemic level to regulate progenitor cell activation and
blastema formation remain critical unsolved issues in the limb regeneration field. A blastema is the bud-like
structure that grows at the tip of the stump following amputation and contains the progenitor cells necessary to
build a new limb. The blastema is essential for regeneration, and, except for the distal-most dip of digits,
mammals do not form blastemas following limb amputation. Thus, understanding the controls, including the
system-wide responses and inputs, that govern progenitor cell activation and blastema formation in
salamanders is key to evaluating limitations observed in mammals. We hypothesize systemically-activated
cells promote local limb regeneration in axolotl salamanders. We further hypothesize that axolotls use the
hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) neuroendocrine system to stimulate systemic activation and that the
central nervous system coordinates injury responses to orchestrate limb regeneration. This project uses
modern tools, such as cell sorting and transplantation, paired scRNA-seq and ATAC-seq, and genome editing,
to understand the biology of systemically-activated cells. This project will also use implanted flexible-mesh
sensors and live neuronal activity recording for evaluating how the axolotl brain responds to limb amputation
and how its activity changes as limbs regenerate. This work will lay the basis for understanding how the CNS
may be required in the limb regeneration process. This project will provide important molecular and systems-
level insights into how a highly-regenerative tetrapod responds to amputation and, ultimately, grows a new
limb. It is therefore likely to have implications in regenerative medicine and evolutionary biology.",Roles of body-wide injury responses in axolotl limb regeneration,"NARRATIVE
 The large unmet need for more robust solutions to limb loss in human patients demands innovative
solutions, and nature provides the ultimate inspiration in salamanders, which have limbs similar to human limbs
but which completely regenerate following amputation. This project is aimed at understanding how axolotls, a
kind of salamander, respond to amputation and create a blastema, a transient structure on the stump
necessary for regeneration. We hypothesize axolotls coordinate the activity of tissue-resident progenitor cells,
the neuroendrocrine system, and the central nervous system for the initiation of limb regeneration and
blastema creation.",https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10895039,ATAC-seq;Adrenal Glands;Adrenergic Agents;Affect;Ambystoma;American;Amputation;Amputees;Anatomy;Antlers;Applied Research;Articulation;Arts;Behavior;Biology;Brain;Brain region;Breathing;Cardiovascular system;Cell Cycle;Cell Separation;Cell Transplantation;Cells;Central Nervous System;Complex;Cues;Data;Deer;Developmental Biology;Diabetes Mellitus;Digit structure;Disease;Distal;Distant;Engineering;Esthesia;Event;Face;Faculty;Foundations;Functional disorder;Future;Goals;Growth;Human;Hypothalamic structure;Implant;Injury;Instruction;Insulin Resistance;Left;Life;Limb structure;Mammals;Modeling;Modernization;Molecular;Morphology;Mus;Natural regeneration;Nature;Neurobiology;Neurons;Neurosecretory Systems;Pathology;Patients;Pattern;Peripheral Nervous System;Pituitary Gland;Pituitary-Adrenal System;Population;Positioning Attribute;Prevalence;Process;Proliferating;Prosthesis;Regenerative Medicine;Regenerative response;Research;Role;Salamander;Schools;Science;Seasons;Signal Transduction;Site;Source;Structure;System;Testing;Tetrapoda;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;Tissues;Universities;Work;appendage;blastema;flexibility;genome editing;hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis;innovation;insight;limb amputation;limb loss;limb regeneration;medical schools;new technology;patient mobility;progenitor;psychological distress;regenerative;regenerative biology;response;response to injury;restoration;sensor;single-cell RNA sequencing;stem cell biology;stem cell proliferation;stem cells;technological innovation;tissue regeneration;tool,10895039,1R01HD115272-01,,,,,,,,"['atac-seq', 'adrenal glands', 'adrenergic agents', 'affect', 'ambystoma', 'american', 'amputation', 'amputees', 'anatomy', 'antlers', 'applied research', 'articulation', 'arts', 'behavior', 'biology', 'brain', 'brain region', 'breathing', 'cardiovascular system', 'cell cycle', 'cell separation', 'cell transplantation', 'cells', 'central nervous system', 'complex', 'cues', 'data', 'deer', 'developmental biology', 'diabetes mellitus', 'digit structure', 'disease', 'distal', 'distant', 'engineering', 'esthesia', 'event', 'face', 'faculty', 'foundations', 'functional disorder', 'future', 'goals', 'growth', 'human', 'hypothalamic structure', 'implant', 'injury', 'instruction', 'insulin resistance', 'left', 'life', 'limb structure', 'mammals', 'modeling', 'modernization', 'molecular', 'morphology', 'mus', 'natural regeneration', 'nature', 'neurobiology', 'neurons', 'neurosecretory systems', 'pathology', 'patients', 'pattern', 'peripheral nervous system', 'pituitary gland', 'pituitary-adrenal system', 'population', 'positioning attribute', 'prevalence', 'process', 'proliferating', 'prosthesis', 'regenerative medicine', 'regenerative response', 'research', 'role', 'salamander', 'schools', 'science', 'seasons', 'signal transduction', 'site', 'source', 'structure', 'system', 'testing', 'tetrapoda', 'therapeutic', 'therapeutic intervention', 'tissues', 'universities', 'work', 'appendage', 'blastema', 'flexibility', 'genome editing', 'hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis', 'innovation', 'insight', 'limb amputation', 'limb loss', 'limb regeneration', 'medical schools', 'new technology', 'patient mobility', 'progenitor', 'psychological distress', 'regenerative', 'regenerative biology', 'response', 'response to injury', 'restoration', 'sensor', 'single-cell rna sequencing', 'stem cell biology', 'stem cell proliferation', 'stem cells', 'technological innovation', 'tissue regeneration', 'tool']",,
"Project summary/Abstract
Adolescence is a developmental period marked by risk-taking behavior and exploration, and
over 60% of 12th-graders in the US reported trying alcohol. In fact, 16% of 12th graders reported
binge drinking, or consuming 5+ drinking in a session. While human studies show that
adolescent binge drinking impacts cognitive performance and neural signals via MRI, it is
difficult to tease apart antecedent factors that may lead to binge drinking from the
consequences of the resulting alcohol exposure on the developing brain. We and others have
used animal models to show that binge-levels of alcohol exposure is sufficient to reduce
cognitive and behavioral flexibility in conditioning tasks. Moreover, these behavioral changes
are associated with a variety of neurochemical, physiological, molecular and epigenetic changes
in the brain. We have reported that adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure resulted
deficient reversal learning, in that rats perseverated on a previously reinforced choice instead of
shifting to a different choice. We also found that AIE-exposed rats exhibited reduced functional
connectivity, measured with resting-state fMRI, among regions of interest that underlie
behavioral choice. Finally, we and others have reported AIE-induced increases in perineuronal
nets (PNNs, extracellular matrix structures that encapsulate parvalbumin (PV)-expressing
interneurons) in frontal regions such as the orbitofrontal cortex. This is important as PV+
interneurons contribute to gamma oscillations that would be reflected in functional connectivity
measures. However, it is unknown whether AIE-induced increases in PNNs contribute to the
AIE-induced behavioral and functional connectivity deficits. This project addresses that
knowledge gap by enzymatically degrading PNNs in the OFC of AIE-exposed rats and
measuring subsequent effects on reversal learning and functional connectivity MRI. To our
knowledge, the resulting data will be the first to link PNN integrity in the OFC to behavioral
flexibility and functional connectivity. These data will contribute to our understanding of the
mechanisms by which AIE persistently disrupts behavior and brain circuit function and lay the
foundation for strategies to ameliorate these effects.",Role of perineuronal nets in adolescent alcohol-induced deficits,"Project narrative

"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bisphenol S (BPS), bisphenol F (BPF), and diisononylphthalate (DINP) are increasingly replacing the endocrine
disrupting chemicals bisphenol A (BPA) and di-2-ethylhexylphthalate (DEHP), respectively. However, BPS, BPF,
and DINP have not undergone safety testing. Perinatal exposures (in utero and during lactation) to BPA and
DEHP are associated with the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD, a common
disease in children, is being diagnosed at increasingly younger ages and its prevalence is increasing in late
adolescence. While BPA and DEHP have been extensively studied in this context, BPS/BPF and DINP have
not. BPS exposure promoted NAFLD progression in zebrafish, and BPF serum levels are higher in NAFLD
patients than in controls. BPS and BPF levels were associated with increased prevalence of obesity in children,
a risk factor for NAFLD. DINP caused lipidomic disruption in neonatal mice, while phthalate exposure caused
hepatic steatosis in adult mice. Thus, like BPA and DEHP, early-life BPS/BPF and DINP exposure may promote
NAFLD development/progression. To date, the mechanisms by which bisphenols and phthalates, particularly as
a mixture, trigger these long-term metabolic consequences are elusive. Here, we will test the hypothesis that
early life exposure to a bisphenol/phthalate mixture activates RAGE signaling pathways, triggers a trained
immune response in peripheral monocytes, and reprograms the epigenome/transcriptome in liver and in
peripheral monocytes, thereby priming offspring for exaggerated metabolic dysfunction upon exposure to
Western diet. This ViCTER consortium will address this novel hypothesis through integrated studies in mice and
in human subjects.",Early Life Exposure to Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals: Epigenomic and Transcriptomic Networks and RAGE in Liver Disease,"PROJECT NARRATIVE
Early life exposures to endocrine disrupting chemicals, such as bisphenols and phthalates, can increase the
lifetime risk of developing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) – a disease that is being increasingly
diagnosed in children. Bisphenols and phthalates have been shown to trigger release of Damage Associated
Molecular Pattern (DAMP) proteins that promote oxidative, inflammatory, and metabolic stress through activation
of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) signaling and epigenomic reprogramming. Our
proposed studies will test the hypothesis that exposure to a bisphenol/phthalate mixture activates DAMP/RAGE
signaling, alters the epigenomic/transcriptomic landscape in liver and peripheral monocytes, and promotes
metabolic dysfunction upon later life challenge (e.g., Western diet).",https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10774009,Adolescence;Adolescent;Adult;Adverse effects;Age;Bioinformatics;Biological;Biological Markers;Biology;Biometry;Bone Marrow;Cell Death;Cells;Child;Child Health;Collaborations;Data;Development;Diagnosis;Diethylhexyl Phthalate;Disease;Disease Progression;Elderly;Endocrine Disruptors;Environment;Epigenetic Process;Exposure to;Fatty Liver;Human;Human Subject Research;Immune;Immune response;Immunity;Inflammatory;Lactation;Life;Ligands;Link;Liver;Liver diseases;Macrophage;Mediating;Metabolic;Metabolic dysfunction;Metabolic stress;Metabolic syndrome;Metabolism;Molecular;Mus;Myelogenous;New York City;Obesity;Organ;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pattern;Perinatal Exposure;Peripheral;Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell;Pregnant Women;Prevalence;Production;Proteins;Public Health;Receptor Activation;Research Personnel;Risk Factors;Role;Serum;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Stimulus;Stress;Testing;Therapeutic;Training;Zebrafish;bisphenol A;cohort;early childhood;early life exposure;epigenome;epigenomics;fetal;human subject;in utero;in vivo;lifetime risk;lipidomics;liver injury;monocyte;mouse model;neonatal mice;non-alcoholic fatty liver disease;novel;obesity in children;offspring;peripheral blood;phthalates;pregnant;programs;receptor;receptor for advanced glycation endproducts;recruit;response;safety testing;transcriptome;transcriptomics;western diet,10774009,1R01ES034793-01A1,,,,,,,,"['adolescence', 'adolescent', 'adult', 'adverse effects', 'age', 'bioinformatics', 'biological', 'biological markers', 'biology', 'biometry', 'bone marrow', 'cell death', 'cells', 'child', 'child health', 'collaborations', 'data', 'development', 'diagnosis', 'diethylhexyl phthalate', 'disease', 'disease progression', 'elderly', 'endocrine disruptors', 'environment', 'epigenetic process', 'exposure to', 'fatty liver', 'human', 'human subject research', 'immune', 'immune response', 'immunity', 'inflammatory', 'lactation', 'life', 'ligands', 'link', 'liver', 'liver diseases', 'macrophage', 'mediating', 'metabolic', 'metabolic dysfunction', 'metabolic stress', 'metabolic syndrome', 'metabolism', 'molecular', 'mus', 'myelogenous', 'new york city', 'obesity', 'organ', 'pathway interactions', 'patients', 'pattern', 'perinatal exposure', 'peripheral', 'peripheral blood mononuclear cell', 'pregnant women', 'prevalence', 'production', 'proteins', 'public health', 'receptor activation', 'research personnel', 'risk factors', 'role', 'serum', 'signal pathway', 'signal transduction', 'stimulus', 'stress', 'testing', 'therapeutic', 'training', 'zebrafish', 'bisphenol a', 'cohort', 'early childhood', 'early life exposure', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'fetal', 'human subject', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'lifetime risk', 'lipidomics', 'liver injury', 'monocyte', 'mouse model', 'neonatal mice', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'offspring', 'peripheral blood', 'phthalates', 'pregnant', 'programs', 'receptor', 'receptor for advanced glycation endproducts', 'recruit', 'response', 'safety testing', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'western diet']",,
"Abstract
Motion effects (including respiratory motion, body motion, cardiac motion) and associated mismatched
attenuation correction substantially degrade the cardiac PET image quality and quantitative accuracy. Although
a number of motion correction methods have been implemented on clinical scanners, they 1) are largely
respiratory motion corrections requiring external motion tracking hardware; and 2) does not take into account
motion-induced PET-CT mismatch in attenuation correction. The correction of motion for 82Rb cardiac dynamic
PET imaging is particularly challenging, as the rapid tracer kinetics of 82Rb leads to substantial tracer distribution
change in the dynamic frame images over time. 82Rb’s ultra-short half-life of only 75 seconds also poses
additional significant challenges of image noise.
In this R01, we propose to develop a series of motion correction methods with aligned PET-CT for both static
and dynamic cardiac applications. All the new developments proposed here are data-driven based approaches,
meaning no external motion tracking hardware is required. We will focus on cardiac PET data with 82Rb as the
tracer, while most of the developments can be directly applied to other tracers. The proposed motion correction
technology developments and translations will have a significant impact on both currently used clinical protocols
and emerging new applications, such as evaluation of endocardial/epicardial (EN/EP) flow ratios. Specifically, in
Aim 1, we will develop and optimize respiratory and bulk body motion correction methods. In Aim 2, we will
develop and optimize data-driven methods to correct cardiac (intra-beat) motion. In Aim 3, we will develop
methods to correct PET/CT mis-alignment due to motion. All the developed technologies will be evaluated and
validated using human and large animal data. In Aim 4, the industry partner of this grant will translate the
developed motion correction methods to end-users.",Development and Translation of Advanced Motion Correction Technologies for Cardiac PET/CT,"Narrative

"Project Summary
 The overall aim of this project is to determine the contribution of the rostral region of the posterior hypothalamic
nucleus (rPH) in stress adaptation. More specifically, stress habituation is defined as a progressive reduction in
responses upon repeated exposures to the same (homotypic) stressor. Psychological or “emotional” stressors
elicit a range of behavioral, autonomic, and neuroendocrine responses that normally help organisms cope with
perceived or actual threatening situations. However, prolonged, unabated and chronic stress exposure is
frequently associated with the development, precipitation, or exacerbation of several psychopathologies and
physical disorders. The sustained activation of stress responsive systems can negatively affect physiologic
functions and ultimately, survival. Thus, the reduction or inhibition of stress-elicited responses afforded by
habituation is likely a vital mechanism serving to reduce the cumulative impact of the same stressors experienced
repeatedly. Importantly, impaired habituation has been reported in several human clinical populations including
anxiety and mood disorders. Unfortunately, the neural mechanisms responsible for stress habituation are still ill-
defined, which makes it currently impossible to evaluate the contribution of habituation in psychopathologies.
 In this application, robust habituated neuroendocrine, autonomic and behavioral responses will be obtained
to repeated homotypic stress paradigms that will test the response specificity and generality of the proposed
brain manipulations. Based on detailed anatomical and functional results from our laboratory, emphasis will be
placed on the role of the rPH in the acquisition of stress habituation. Anatomically, the rPH is located at a focal
intersection between several sensory, limbic forebrain, and effector response systems activated by various
stressors, placing it in a unique position to undergo habituation-related plasticity that can regulate coordinated
responses to stress. The first aim is therefore directed at evaluating the novel hypothesis that the rPH region,
and some of its specific cell populations, contribute to the acquisition of stress habituation. Aim 2 seeks to
evaluate the possibility that intrinsic rPH neural activity is modified by repeated homotypic stress. Throughout
these aims, both female and male rats will be evaluated for putative rPH-related differences in stress adaptation
due to the differential prevalence of gender to anxiety and mood disorders and the widely reported sex
differences in habituation to stress. The proposed anatomical, functional and behavioral analyses of the rPH in
stress adaptation through habituation is novel and will provide converging evidence implicating this brain region
in stress adaptation and its sequelae.",Posterior Hypothalamic Contribution to Stress Adaptation,"Project Narrative
 Whereas innate responses to stress provide many important physiological mechanisms to help cope with the
demands of daily challenges, the prolonged or repeated exposure to stress is associated with several
psychopathologies and physical disorders. The current application seeks new information about a brain region,
the rostral region of the posterior hypothalamic nucleus, that is centrally situated to integrate multiple sources of
information, coordinate multiple stress-related responses, and that may significantly contribute to reduce the
impact of repeated stress. This novel hypothesis could provide a breakthrough in the understanding of this
normal, but ill-defined, stress adaptive process, which could suggest new avenues for the treatment of mood
and anxiety disorders.",https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10889744,Affective;Amygdaloid structure;Anatomy;Anxiety Disorders;Behavioral;Brain;Brain region;Calcium;Cardiovascular system;Catecholamines;Cell Nucleus;Cells;Chronic stress;Clinical;Cognitive;Complex;Decision Making;Development;Disease;Elements;Emotional;Etiology;Exposure to;Female;Fiber;Gender;Genetic;Genetic Techniques;Genetic Transcription;Glucocorticoids;Glutamates;Human;Hypothalamic structure;Impairment;Incidence;Individual;Laboratories;Lead;Limbic System;Mediating;Memory;Methods;Modality;Modification;Mood Disorders;Moods;Neurosecretory Systems;Neurotransmitters;Nodal;Organism;Photometry;Physiological;Population;Positioning Attribute;Posterior Hypothalamus;Precipitation;Prevalence;Process;Prosencephalon;Psychopathology;Rattus;Reaction;Recurrence;Regulation;Reporting;Risk;Role;Sensory;Sex Differences;Signal Transduction;Source;Specific qualifier value;Specificity;Stress;Structure of paraventricular nucleus of thalamus;System;Techniques;Testing;Transcriptional Regulation;Viral;behavioral response;biological adaptation to stress;cognitive function;coping;design;designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs;experience;gamma-Aminobutyric Acid;habituation;indexing;male;negative affect;nerve supply;neural;neural circuit;neuroadaptation;neuromechanism;novel;novel therapeutics;postsynaptic;presynaptic;promoter;psychologic;response;sensor;sex;stress reduction;stressor,10889744,1R21MH133108-01A1,,,,,,,,"['affective', 'amygdaloid structure', 'anatomy', 'anxiety disorders', 'behavioral', 'brain', 'brain region', 'calcium', 'cardiovascular system', 'catecholamines', 'cell nucleus', 'cells', 'chronic stress', 'clinical', 'cognitive', 'complex', 'decision making', 'development', 'disease', 'elements', 'emotional', 'etiology', 'exposure to', 'female', 'fiber', 'gender', 'genetic', 'genetic techniques', 'genetic transcription', 'glucocorticoids', 'glutamates', 'human', 'hypothalamic structure', 'impairment', 'incidence', 'individual', 'laboratories', 'lead', 'limbic system', 'mediating', 'memory', 'methods', 'modality', 'modification', 'mood disorders', 'moods', 'neurosecretory systems', 'neurotransmitters', 'nodal', 'organism', 'photometry', 'physiological', 'population', 'positioning attribute', 'posterior hypothalamus', 'precipitation', 'prevalence', 'process', 'prosencephalon', 'psychopathology', 'rattus', 'reaction', 'recurrence', 'regulation', 'reporting', 'risk', 'role', 'sensory', 'sex differences', 'signal transduction', 'source', 'specific qualifier value', 'specificity', 'stress', 'structure of paraventricular nucleus of thalamus', 'system', 'techniques', 'testing', 'transcriptional regulation', 'viral', 'behavioral response', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cognitive function', 'coping', 'design', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'experience', 'gamma-aminobutyric acid', 'habituation', 'indexing', 'male', 'negative affect', 'nerve supply', 'neural', 'neural circuit', 'neuroadaptation', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'promoter', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'sex', 'stress reduction', 'stressor']",,
"Summary
The 17th Annual CounterACT Network Research Symposium is designed to provide scientists
working across the chemical countermeasure field with the latest research findings on the mechanisms
of chemical threats, the identification or development of novel countermeasures and their translation to
relevant clinical scenarios. This research conference has been held annually since 2007 and is the main
venue for interactions among the scientists funded by the successful NIH CounterACT Program. The
symposium brings together an emerging set of trainees in this important scientific area and a range of
external investigators with closely aligned interests from federal agencies and potential industrial
partners. There are also a number of guests from other countermeasure programs across the world
and consultants from relevant Federal programs in attendance. The meeting is internationally known
for the high-quality, cutting-edge nature of the science presented and has a track record of progressive
growth over the last 16 years with the strategic funding and oversight from the CounterACT program.
The 17th Annual CounterACT Symposium will be held June 3-5, 2023 in Park City, UT. The program for
the meeting described in this application has been assembled around the themes permeating the NIH
CounterACT Network, which have collectively changed the way we think about the breadth and pace
of discovery and development for countermeasures against existing and emerging chemical threats. In
addition to the Core sessions, where progress in each funded project will be presented, we have also
included Plenary sessions designed to highlight the trajectory of the program as an exemplar of
systematic approaches to understanding the interactions between environmental chemicals and human
mortality or morbidity. To complete the program and to continue to develop a cadre of emerging
investigators in the relevant fields, we have also developed a short Program for trainees designed to:
(1) provide them with the basic background on common mechanisms involved in clinical toxidromes to
maximize their understanding of the science in the broader conference, (2) receive feedback on their

"Abstract
 Precision medicine in oncology requires accurate prediction of drug response to guide personalized
treatment decisions. We developed a pharmacoproteomics platform that links kinome activity in liver cancer
cell lines to kinase inhibitor drug response. Preliminary results indicate that our KI-Predictor’s ability to identify
dysregulated kinase signaling is highly dependent on cellular context. To examine and optimize our predictive
model, we will use samples of normal human liver tissue and other inputs and evaluate its performance using
additional liver cell lines and the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) datasets. In parallel, we
propose to evaluate our KI-Predictor by profiling kinome activity in clinical liver cancer samples, selecting
candidate kinase inhibitors for testing in organotypic slice cultures derived from each individual patient’s tumor.
By comparing the predicted drug response with the observed response in the organotypic slice culture models,
the accuracy and reliability of the KI-Predictor model can be evaluated. This validation step enables the
assessment of the model's ability to capture the complexities of the tumor microenvironment, including
interactions between cancer cells, stromal cells, and the extracellular matrix.",Proteomic signatures to predict drug response in cancer,"Public Health Relevance/Narrative

"Abstract
 Direct intravenous delivery of gasses has been always considered an absolute contraindication due to
the fear of air embolism. However, if it were made possible, direct intravenous high content oxygen solutions
could ameliorate injury, improve tissue hypoxia and buy time for definitive interventions and/or prevent invasive
interventions such intubations. The basic resting minute oxygen requirements of a human are 3ml/kg/min or 200-
300 ml of O2/min. During CPR, blood flow is significantly decreased and oxygenation at the lungs is frequently
severely impaired. Both those conditions lead to vital organ and whole-body hypoxia. An effort to increase the
overall oxygen content of circulating blood could have significant effect on end-organ oxygenation even with
lower blood flow and could significant delay irreversible injury that leads to significant morbidity and eventually
mortality in this patient population.
 We have developed a method with which a highly pressured mixture of saline and oxygen can
be delivered directly into the vein at 1 Atm in order to dramatically increase the circulating oxygen blood
content. We utilize high pressures (50-100 Atm) at room temperature (25-28C) to dissolve large volumes of
oxygen in the infusate to make a clinically relevant therapy and sustain body oxygen requirements for up to 10-
20 min/L of saline infused. The concept is based on the simple idea that when the highly pressurized solution
(eg. at 50 atm and 25C the dissolved volume of O2 /saline is ~2.5/1) is released under constant pressure
through a nozzle that controls bubble nucleation rate and bubble size distribution evolution, a “mist” consisting
of nucleated nanobubbles and saline water molecules can be delivered, which can be directly mixed with the
returning venous blood. The presence of venous, unsaturated hemoglobin acts as an absorption sink for the
delivered O2nanobubble solution (O2NBS). An optimal rate of mixing can be safe and minimize bubble formations
through the process of immediate O2 uptake. Residual nanobubbles do not coalesce and therefore could
circulate uninterrupted through the circulatory system to act as an additional oxygen reservoir.
 In Aim 1 we will study the physics and engineering methods to optimize the solution and nanobubble
size characteristics under different upstream Pr/nozzle conditions. We aim to minimize nanobubble average size
to safely deliver it in saline at 1atm and 37C. Aims 2 and 3 will assess the effect of the intravenous oxygen
solution on blood and tissue oxygenation in animal models of simulated cardiac arrest and during prolonged
CPR. Finally, a large 72 -hour survival study will be performed. The implications to public health are self-evident
and far-reaching for diseases like cardiac arrest, hypoxic respiratory failure, emergencies requiring intubation
and anesthesia.",Nanobubble oxygenation in cardiac arrest and acute vital organ ischemia,"Narrative

"PROJECT SUMMARY
Well-characterized longitudinal epidemiological cohorts are crucial resources for identifying novel risk factors,
examining exposure-outcome associations, and determining the role of biomarkers in disease development and
progression. The Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW) is a unique environmental epidemiological cohort
where rigorous survey methodology was used to ensure state-wide participation from Wisconsin, resulting in a
representative sample. Based on our successful experience in participant recruitment, we propose to initiate
SHOW-Forward to further enhance diversity of the cohort, enrich already collected data and expand its access
to the research community to facilitate novel environmental epidemiology and translational research aligned with
the NIEHS mission. To accomplish these goals, we propose three specific aims. First, we will expand the SHOW
cohort through continued and enhanced outreach and engagement of underserved and underrepresented
populations in Wisconsin. Novel approaches for participant-centric biospecimen collection will be implemented
to reduce the burden for participants from rural areas with limited access to health care resources. Second, we
will develop the SHOW Real World Data Collaborative infrastructure as a foundation for secure integrative
environmental health research. Third, we will establish the administrative infrastructure to develop, refine, and
conduct participant recruitment, ethical and compliant acquisition, linkage, usage, analysis and sharing of PHI-
containing multi-dimensional data and annotated biospecimens. Ultimately, this collaborative infrastructure will
facilitate broad access to SHOW data and biospecimens, enable early detection and treatment of emerging
health issues, improve understanding of the role of environmental and lifestyle factors, harmful chemical
exposures, and genetics on human health, and unlock new pathways for evidence-based prevention of
environmentally caused diseases.","SHOW-Forward: A pathway for enhancing participant diversity, enriching data, and improving access to a unique environmental epidemiology cohort","PROJECT NARRATIVE

"Project Summary
Project 1: Evolution and Durability of allo(auto)immune B cell responses in organ transplant recipients
Antibodies (Abs), which are produced by B lineage-derived Ab secreting cells (ASCs) following pathogen
exposure and vaccination, play critical roles in protection from infection. However, ASCs and Abs can be
pathogenic if directed against the wrong target, as is the case for autoimmune disease and organ transplantation.
In the setting of kidney transplant (KT), Abs made by the recipient directed against the donor's Major
Histocompatibility Complex or Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) proteins (donor-specific Ab, DSA) contribute to
Ab-mediated rejection (AMR). Pre-formed DSA at the time of transplant can cause acute AMR and de novo DSA,
which is elicited months to years after transplantation, can cause chronic AMR. Both conditions are difficult to
treat and associated with organ failure. Thus, while overall transplant success rates have improved, there is still
a need to better understand the fundamental mechanisms that control the development, evolution and
durability of the B cell and B cell-derived DSA responses against donor (allo) HLA Class-I and Class-II. In fact,
we know remarkably little about B cell responses to alloHLA proteins, which unlike pathogen-derived antigens,
are very similar to the HLA proteins expressed by the patient (selfHLA). Studies using Rituximab to deplete
circulating B cells in DSA+ transplant patients reveal that DSA levels remain high in many patients. These data
support the idea that the DSA response is largely driven by Rituximab-resistant long-lived bone marrow ASCs
(LL-ASC). However, memory B cells (Bmem), particularly those that reside in tissues, are also more resistant to
Rituximab and both Bmem and LL-ASCs are formed by germinal center (GC) B cell responses that can take
place in lymphoid and inflamed tissues. Bmem, which can rapidly differentiate into new cohorts of ASCs, could
potentially serve as a reservoir to sustain systemic Ab responses. We found that HLA-reactive Bmem were
present in the blood and kidney of a DSA+ KT patient diagnosed with AMR. These HLA-specific B cells were
present in expanded B cell lineages and the BCRs expressed by these B cells were high affinity, class-switched
and extensively somatically mutated, suggesting that they were generated via a TFH-dependent GC response.
Moreover, we observed extensive clonal relationships between the Bmem and ASCs in both tissues and we
identified Bmem and ASCs lineages that contributed to the serum DSA response. Intriguingly, many of the
recombinant monoclonal Abs derived from multiple HLA-reactive B cell lineages bound both donor alloHLA and
selfHLA. Therefore, we hypothesize that ongoing evolution of the alloHLA B cell response occurs in the face of
a durable low affinity selfHLA response, which is not censored. The immediate goals of Project 1 are to: (i) define
the B cell populations in blood and kidney that contribute to HLA reactivity, and (ii) determine how the kidney
and recirculating alloHLA reactive B cells evolve with time and following immune perturbations. We believe these
experiments are important as gaining a more complete understanding of how B cell responses to alloHLA are
initiated and maintained may, in the future, allow for better design of therapies to prevent or treat AMR.",Project 1: Evolution and Durability of allo(auto)immune B cell responses in organ transplant recipients,,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10824857,Acute;Address;Affect;Affinity;Alleles;Allografting;Amino Acids;Antibodies;Antibody Response;Antigens;Autoimmune Diseases;B-Lymphocyte Subsets;B-Lymphocytes;Binding;Biopsy;Blood;Blood specimen;Bone Marrow;Cell Compartmentation;Cell Lineage;Cell secretion;Cells;Chronic;Clinical;Clonal Expansion;Cloning;Data;Development;Diagnosis;Evolution;Excision;Exhibits;Future;Goals;Graft Rejection;HLA Antigens;Histocompatibility Antigens Class I;Homeostasis;Human;Immune;Immune response;Immunoglobulin Class Switching;Immunoglobulin-Secreting Cells;Immunologics;Immunomodulators;Immunotherapy;In Situ;Incidence;Infection;Injury to Kidney;Intervention;Kidney;Kidney Transplantation;Knowledge;Learning;Life;Link;Lymphoid;MS4A1 gene;Major Histocompatibility Complex;Measures;Mediating;Memory B-Lymphocyte;Monoclonal Antibodies;Mutate;Nephrectomy;Organ Transplantation;Organ failure;Pathogenesis;Pathogenicity;Patients;Play;Population;Property;Proteins;Recombinants;Reporting;Research;Resistance;Role;Serum;Source;Structure of germinal center of lymph node;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Time;Tissue Transplantation;Tissues;Transplant Recipients;Transplantation;Uterus;Vaccination;Work;adaptive immune response;antibody-mediated rejection;arm;cohort;design;donor-specific antibody;experimental study;improved;isoimmunity;kidney allograft;organ transplant recipient;organ transplant rejection;pathogen;pathogen exposure;precursor cell;prevent;prognostic tool;reconstitution;response;rituximab;success;therapy design,10824857,1U19AI181105-01,,,,,,,,"['acute', 'address', 'affect', 'affinity', 'alleles', 'allografting', 'amino acids', 'antibodies', 'antibody response', 'antigens', 'autoimmune diseases', 'b-lymphocyte subsets', 'b-lymphocytes', 'binding', 'biopsy', 'blood', 'blood specimen', 'bone marrow', 'cell compartmentation', 'cell lineage', 'cell secretion', 'cells', 'chronic', 'clinical', 'clonal expansion', 'cloning', 'data', 'development', 'diagnosis', 'evolution', 'excision', 'exhibits', 'future', 'goals', 'graft rejection', 'hla antigens', 'histocompatibility antigens class i', 'homeostasis', 'human', 'immune', 'immune response', 'immunoglobulin class switching', 'immunoglobulin-secreting cells', 'immunologics', 'immunomodulators', 'immunotherapy', 'in situ', 'incidence', 'infection', 'injury to kidney', 'intervention', 'kidney', 'kidney transplantation', 'knowledge', 'learning', 'life', 'link', 'lymphoid', 'ms4a1 gene', 'major histocompatibility complex', 'measures', 'mediating', 'memory b-lymphocyte', 'monoclonal antibodies', 'mutate', 'nephrectomy', 'organ transplantation', 'organ failure', 'pathogenesis', 'pathogenicity', 'patients', 'play', 'population', 'property', 'proteins', 'recombinants', 'reporting', 'research', 'resistance', 'role', 'serum', 'source', 'structure of germinal center of lymph node', 't-lymphocyte', 'testing', 'time', 'tissue transplantation', 'tissues', 'transplant recipients', 'transplantation', 'uterus', 'vaccination', 'work', 'adaptive immune response', 'antibody-mediated rejection', 'arm', 'cohort', 'design', 'donor-specific antibody', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'isoimmunity', 'kidney allograft', 'organ transplant recipient', 'organ transplant rejection', 'pathogen', 'pathogen exposure', 'precursor cell', 'prevent', 'prognostic tool', 'reconstitution', 'response', 'rituximab', 'success', 'therapy design']",,
"PROJECT SUMMARY
Project 2: Genesis and dynamics of human endometrial resident memory T cells revealed by uterus
transplant recipients
Most T cells in the human body are located within individual tissues as antigen-experienced, resident memory T
cells (TRM). However, much of the scientific knowledge about human T cells has been generated from studies of
peripheral blood and secondary lymphoid organs where most T cells are naive. Unfortunately, many of the
lessons learned from T cells in peripheral blood may therefore not apply to tissue resident immune cells because
tissue environments shape immune cell differentiation and responses in ways that do not occur in other anatomic
compartments. We therefore lack the knowledge necessary to manipulate tissue resident cells to our advantage
to treat a variety of diseases and patient populations. Tissue resident memory T cells are an antigen-experienced,
adaptive immune population that play a critical role in protective immunity to pathogens. We address this
knowledge gap in this proposal through the study of TRM in the human uterine endometrium. Notably, TRM
recruitment, composition, and longevity may be distinctly different in the human endometrium versus other
tissues because the endometrium undergoes hundreds of cycles of coordinated tissue loss and regeneration
over the course of a lifetime. We have combined cutting-edge next generation sequencing methodologies with
access to the endometrium of healthy control volunteers and human uterus transplant recipients to answer
questions about TRM trafficking and differentiation that will advance our understanding of human tissue immunity.
We expect that this proposal will have particular impact for women's health and transplant recipients but may
also inform vaccine strategies and cancer therapeutics as well. In summary, we expect that the knowledge
generated by this proposal can be used to expand our capabilities to modulate the human immune system and
treat a variety of human diseases.",Project 2: Genesis and dynamics of human endometrial resident memory T cells revealed by uterus transplant recipients,,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10824858,Address;Affect;Anatomy;Antigens;Automobile Driving;B-Lymphocytes;Biological;Biology;Biopsy;Blood;Cell Compartmentation;Cell Differentiation process;Cell Separation;Cells;Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing;Circulation;Clone Cells;Data;Data Set;Decidua;Disease;Endometrial;Endometrium;Environment;Environmental Exposure;Epithelial Cells;Event;Evolution;Exposure to;Flow Cytometry;Gene Expression Profiling;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Health;Human;Human body;Immune;Immune system;Immunity;In Vitro;Individual;Infection;Interleukin-15;Knowledge;Learning;Longevity;Longitudinal Studies;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Menstrual cycle;Methodology;Mixed Lymphocyte Culture Test;Modeling;Molecular;Morphology;Mus;Natural regeneration;Organ;Organ Transplantation;Ovulation;Pathway interactions;Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell;Phase;Physiological;Play;Population;Progesterone;Proteins;Regulon;Residencies;Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction;Role;Sampling;Shapes;Signal Transduction;Stromal Cells;T cell receptor repertoire sequencing;T memory cell;T-Cell Proliferation;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Tissues;Transforming Growth Factor beta;Transplant Recipients;Transplantation;Uterus;Women&apos;s Health;antigen test;epigenetic profiling;exome sequencing;experience;human disease;human tissue;improved;inhibitor;insight;next generation sequencing;nuclear factors of activated T-cells;pathogen;patient population;peripheral blood;pharmacologic;post pregnancy;programs;recruit;regenerative;residence;response;secondary lymphoid organ;single-cell RNA sequencing;synergism;tissue resident memory T cell;trafficking;vaccine strategy;volunteer;wound,10824858,1U19AI181105-01,,,,,,,,"['address', 'affect', 'anatomy', 'antigens', 'automobile driving', 'b-lymphocytes', 'biological', 'biology', 'biopsy', 'blood', 'cell compartmentation', 'cell differentiation process', 'cell separation', 'cells', 'cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing', 'circulation', 'clone cells', 'data', 'data set', 'decidua', 'disease', 'endometrial', 'endometrium', 'environment', 'environmental exposure', 'epithelial cells', 'event', 'evolution', 'exposure to', 'flow cytometry', 'gene expression profiling', 'genes', 'genetic transcription', 'health', 'human', 'human body', 'immune', 'immune system', 'immunity', 'in vitro', 'individual', 'infection', 'interleukin-15', 'knowledge', 'learning', 'longevity', 'longitudinal studies', 'malignant neoplasms', 'measures', 'menstrual cycle', 'methodology', 'mixed lymphocyte culture test', 'modeling', 'molecular', 'morphology', 'mus', 'natural regeneration', 'organ', 'organ transplantation', 'ovulation', 'pathway interactions', 'peripheral blood mononuclear cell', 'phase', 'physiological', 'play', 'population', 'progesterone', 'proteins', 'regulon', 'residencies', 'reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction', 'role', 'sampling', 'shapes', 'signal transduction', 'stromal cells', 't cell receptor repertoire sequencing', 't memory cell', 't-cell proliferation', 't-lymphocyte', 'testing', 'therapeutic', 'time', 'tissues', 'transforming growth factor beta', 'transplant recipients', 'transplantation', 'uterus', 'women&apos', 's health', 'antigen test', 'epigenetic profiling', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'inhibitor', 'insight', 'next generation sequencing', 'nuclear factors of activated t-cells', 'pathogen', 'patient population', 'peripheral blood', 'pharmacologic', 'post pregnancy', 'programs', 'recruit', 'regenerative', 'residence', 'response', 'secondary lymphoid organ', 'single-cell rna sequencing', 'synergism', 'tissue resident memory t cell', 'trafficking', 'vaccine strategy', 'volunteer', 'wound']",,
"Abstract
C. difficile infection (CDI) is the most common nosocomial bacterial infection in the United States, accounting
for more than 1.5 billion dollars in annual healthcare expenditures in this country. The most common and
resource intensive treatment gap in CDI is disease persistence and recurrence, which together occurs in 15-
30% of patients following a first course of antibiotic therapy. Recent evidence suggests a role for cooperative
transkingdom interactions between fungi and bacteria in this disease. Dr. Lamendella has produced most of
these data in microbiome studies from mice and humans. Mice pre-colonized with Candida glabrata
experienced greater severity and lethality of CDI. Dr. Lamendella has led three different, published human
studies which revealed strong enrichment of fungal taxa, especially C. glabrata, among CDI patients, while
patients of comparable age, gender, chronic comorbidities, and antibiotic exposure with C. difficile negative
diarrhea lack this fungal enrichment. With comparable antibiotic exposure between our cohorts, this fungal
enrichment is not an antibiotic epiphenomenon, but rather it represents a previously unrecognized component
of CDI that influences disease severity while serving as a promising, previously unappreciated therapeutic
target. The central hypothesis of this work is that C. glabrata and C. difficile have interspecies
interactions through metabolic and signaling pathways that affect CDI severity and outcome. We will
use CDI+ and CDI- human stool to identify key metabolic pathways and interactions between C. glabrata and
C. difficile to further describe the role of fungi in CDI pathogenesis. We will perform matched metagenomic
(MG) and metatranscriptomic (MT) studies of >500 human stools linked with deidentified clinical and
immunological metadata, obtained from three collaborating university hospitals to identify how C. glabrata
influences CDI through mechanisms including nutrient competition, modulation of the immune response,
quorum sensing, and biofilm formation. Dr. Lamendella will lead a team of student researchers, with a
particular emphasis on recruiting underrepresented students, who will leverage high-thoughput sequencing,
bioinformatics analyses, and machine learning models to discover the functional underpinnings of fungi’s role
in CDI. Our first aim will validate our preliminary observations that fungi (especially C. glabrata) directly or
indirectly exacerbate CDI. This aim will establish the prevalence and differential activity of C. glabrata in CDI.
These data are integral to determining the differential metabolic pathways and will enable multivariate
associations with CDI status, clinical metadata, immune markers, and microbial meta-omics features. The
second aim of this proposal will validate features of C. glabrata that are predictive of CDI using genome-scale
metabolic models. Machine learning will be used to extract relevant features that best distinguish CDI. The
long-term goal is to further develop the novel concept, first described by Dr. Lamendella’s team, that fungi have
a role in CDI and are a promising therapeutic target for this disease.",Multi-omics integration to model the differential metabolic activities of Candida glabrata and bacteria in humans with C. difficile infection,"Project Narrative
This study will introduce a paradigm shift in how the microbiome alterations characterizing C. difficile infection
(CDI) are viewed, one that would be highly clinically relevant toward improving our knowledge, and potentially
our treatment, of a disease responsible for over 1.5 billion dollars in annual healthcare costs in the United
States. The data from this project will help establish the role of fungi in CDI, especially C. glabrata; the role of
fungi could help to explain the persistently elevated rate of treatment failures observed in current CDI therapy.
The results of this project will broaden the scientific community’s understanding of the pathogenesis of CDI,
while furthering work by Dr. Lamendella’s team, suggesting that fungi may be a therapeutic target in treating
CDI.",https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10847966,Accounting;Affect;Age;Anti-Bacterial Agents;Antibiotic Therapy;Antibiotics;Bacteria;Bacterial Infections;Big Data;Bioinformatics;Biological;Biological Markers;Biomedical Research;Candida albicans;Candida glabrata;Chronic;Clinical;Clostridium difficile;Collaborations;Communities;Country;DNA;Data;Development;Diarrhea;Disease;Enterococcus;Environment;Exhibits;FDA approved;Feces;Fostering;Funding;Funding Mechanisms;Fungal Components;Future;Gastrointestinal tract structure;Gender;Genes;Genome;Genomics;Goals;Growth;Health Care Costs;Health Expenditures;Human;Immune response;Immunologic Markers;Immunologics;Individual;Infection;Knowledge;Lead;Link;Machine Learning;Maps;Metabolic;Metabolic Pathway;Metadata;Metagenomics;Microbial Biofilms;Modeling;Mus;Nosocomial Infections;Nutrient;Outcome;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Prevalence;Publishing;RNA;Recurrence;Relapse;Research;Research Personnel;Resources;Role;Scientist;Severities;Severity of illness;Signal Pathway;Students;Taxonomy;Technology;Treatment Failure;Treatment outcome;Underrepresented Students;United States;University Hospitals;Validation;Visualization;Work;animal data;anti-fungal agents;biobank;clinically relevant;cohort;comorbidity;complex biological systems;computerized tools;differential expression;experience;fungus;genome-wide;immunoregulation;improved;machine learning model;member;metabolomics;metatranscriptomics;microbial;microbial genome;microbiome alteration;microbiome research;multiple omics;neural network;novel;potential biomarker;programs;quorum sensing;recruit;skills;stool sample;therapeutic target;tool,10847966,1R16AI182344-01,,,,,,,,"['accounting', 'affect', 'age', 'anti-bacterial agents', 'antibiotic therapy', 'antibiotics', 'bacteria', 'bacterial infections', 'big data', 'bioinformatics', 'biological', 'biological markers', 'biomedical research', 'candida albicans', 'candida glabrata', 'chronic', 'clinical', 'clostridium difficile', 'collaborations', 'communities', 'country', 'dna', 'data', 'development', 'diarrhea', 'disease', 'enterococcus', 'environment', 'exhibits', 'fda approved', 'feces', 'fostering', 'funding', 'funding mechanisms', 'fungal components', 'future', 'gastrointestinal tract structure', 'gender', 'genes', 'genome', 'genomics', 'goals', 'growth', 'health care costs', 'health expenditures', 'human', 'immune response', 'immunologic markers', 'immunologics', 'individual', 'infection', 'knowledge', 'lead', 'link', 'machine learning', 'maps', 'metabolic', 'metabolic pathway', 'metadata', 'metagenomics', 'microbial biofilms', 'modeling', 'mus', 'nosocomial infections', 'nutrient', 'outcome', 'pathogenesis', 'pathway interactions', 'patients', 'pharmaceutical preparations', 'prevalence', 'publishing', 'rna', 'recurrence', 'relapse', 'research', 'research personnel', 'resources', 'role', 'scientist', 'severities', 'severity of illness', 'signal pathway', 'students', 'taxonomy', 'technology', 'treatment failure', 'treatment outcome', 'underrepresented students', 'united states', 'university hospitals', 'validation', 'visualization', 'work', 'animal data', 'anti-fungal agents', 'biobank', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'complex biological systems', 'computerized tools', 'differential expression', 'experience', 'fungus', 'genome-wide', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'machine learning model', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'metatranscriptomics', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'microbiome alteration', 'microbiome research', 'multiple omics', 'neural network', 'novel', 'potential biomarker', 'programs', 'quorum sensing', 'recruit', 'skills', 'stool sample', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",,
"Project Summary/Abstract
Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains among the leading causes of deaths in the U.S. While a sedentary
lifestyle, unhealthful diets, smoking behaviors, and genetic predispositions are established risk factors of CHD,
emerging evidence suggests that environmental pollutants, such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances
(PFAS), may also contribute to the CHD etiology. Potential connections between PFAS exposures and
dyslipidemia have been extensively examined in epidemiological studies, although significant heterogeneity
among studies was observed. More recent evidence suggests that PFAS may particularly interfere with the
metabolism of pro-atherogenic lipoprotein subspecies that carry apolipoprotein CIII and other apolipoproteins,
which are significantly associated with CHD risk in multiple prospective studies. This new evidence points to a
new pathway through which PFAS may influence CHD risk. Data are still sparse regarding the inter-
relationships among PFAS, lipoprotein subspecies, and incident CHD risk in the U.S. population who are
ubiquitously exposed to PFAS. The proposed research aims to address these important knowledge gaps by
conducting cross-sectional and longitudinal investigations to substantiate the associations of PFAS with
lipoprotein subspecies and CHD risk in four well-characterized U.S. cohort studies consisting of ethnically-
diverse participants: the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, Nurses’ Health Study (NHS), NHSII, and
Hispanic Community Health Study / Study of Latinos (SOL). The rich, existing resources and data allow the
investigators to cost-effectively examine these study aims: 1) to examine various PFAS in relation to lipoprotein
subspecies in blood samples repeatedly collected during the past three decades; 2) to evaluate longitudinally
the changes of PFAS in relation to the contemporaneous changes of lipoprotein subspecies in repeat blood
samples collected ~10 years apart in the NHS/NHSII and SOL cohorts; and 3) to investigate prospective
associations between PFAS and CHD risk and to explore the role of the lipoprotein subspecies in these
associations of interest. Besides filling the knowledge gaps, the innovation of the proposed research also lies
in the coverage of some newly emerged PFAS that can only be meaningfully measured in blood samples
collected recently, the examination of longitudinal relationships between PFAS and lipoprotein subspecies, and
the inclusion of Hispanic participants from the SOL cohort. A highly experienced investigator team consisting of
environmental and cardiovascular disease epidemiologists, lipoprotein and PFAS research experts, and
biostatisticians has been assembled to achieve the study goals in a timely fashion with great qualities. Data
from this proposed research will shed light on the role of PFAS exposures in modulating lipoprotein subspecies
and CHD risk in U.S. populations. Such evidence may also aid in policy-making processes for making more
evidence-based regulations toward the production and use of PFAS in the U.S.","Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, apolipoproteins, and risk of coronary heart disease","Project Narrative/Relevance
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) may predispose human beings to an elevated risk of developing
coronary heart disease (CHD) through modulating blood lipoprotein subspecies that are particularly relevant to
CHD etiology, although epidemiological studies that examine inter-relationships among PFAS, blood
lipoprotein subspecies, and CHD risk are limited. The proposed research aims to narrow significant knowledge
gaps by evaluating prospective associations of PFAS exposures with lipoprotein subspecies and CHD
incidence in well-characterized cohort studies of free-living individuals. Data from this research will shed light
on potential effects of PFAS on cardiovascular health and may inform policy-making processes for regulating

"Project Summary
Implantable neuroelectronic interfaces for recording and modulating brain activity can treat drug-resistant
neurological diseases; however, traditional electrode implantation requires invasive open-skull surgery and
poses considerable risks, such as intracortical bleeding and infection, and inevitably damages the brain.
To address these issues, this proposal aims to create a platform for endovascular delivery of chronically-
stable probes for robust recording and modulation of neural activity. In related work, Dr. Anqi Zhang has
demonstrated the feasibility of endovascular implantation and recording by developing flexible neural
probes that can be delivered into sub-100-micron cortical vessels to acutely record local field potentials
and single-unit activity in anesthetized rats. In this proposal, the capabilities of the endovascular probes
will be expanded by first achieving controllable implantation into both superficial and deep cortical vessels
adjacent to common therapeutic targets, followed by systematic studies and characterizations of endovas-
cular recording and stimulation, with a focus on single-unit activity in anesthetized rats, and finally manu-
facturing stretchable endovascular probes for long-term implantation and recording in awake, behaving
rats. This proposal is significant because it will develop a platform technology that can be readily extended
to the detection and treatment of other chronic and progressive neurological diseases, and serves as the
foundation for the clinical translation of minimally invasive neuroelectronic interfaces to neurology, neuro-
surgery, and interventional radiology practice. Dr. Zhang has suitable prior training in chemistry, materials
science, neuroscience, and bioelectronics, and has extensive experience in mentoring and teaching. Dur-
ing the K99 phase of this proposal, Dr. Zhang will be mentored by an experienced team of experts in neu-
rological diseases, cerebrovascular surgery, optogenetics and calcium imaging, in vivo electrophysiology,
and design and fabrication of stretchable devices. Stanford University also provides substantial resources
and support for her professional training. Dr. Zhang’s advisory team will oversee her research progress
and professional development through training in new techniques, clinical translation, job seeking and ne-
gotiation, scientific writing and communication, mentoring, and promoting diversity, equity and inclusion.
Upon completion of this mentored research project, Dr. Zhang will acquire the knowledge and skills neces-
sary to use her strengths in physical sciences and engineering to develop minimally invasive chronic neu-
ral interfaces, and the professional skills that will be extremely beneficial for her transition to become an
independent investigator.",Minimally Invasive Endovascular Neural Interfaces for Brain Recording and Modulation,"Project Narrative

"Therapeutic Targeting in EGFR-amplified Glioblastoma
 Glioblastomas (GBM) are common and the most malignant adult tumors in the central nervous
system with a poor prognosis. Among IDH wild type (WT) GBM under the new 2021 WHO classification,
>55% tumors have EGFR amplification and/or mutations which is an established oncogenic driver of GBM
malignancy and has served as a biomarker and therapeutic target of high interest. However, EGFR-
targeting therapies remain ineffective, clinically, for GBM treatment. The failures of targeting EGFR are
largely attributed to GBM tumor heterogeneity with intertwined oncogenic signaling, dynamic switching
between tumor subtypes, and an immuno-suppressive tumor microenvironment. While the canonical
downstream signaling of EGFR is well understood, other non-canonical pathways remain to be discovered
in order to take advantage of this prevalent oncogenic driver as a therapeutic target in GBM. The goal of
this project is to explore new therapeutic approaches for EGFR-amplified GBM by assessing the role of a
largely uncharacterized gene that is co-amplified with EGFR in GBM, EGFR long non-coding downstream
RNA (ELDR). ELDR is the most up-regulated long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in EGFR-amplified GBM
where ELDR expression augments the tumorigenicity of GBM cells and does so independently of EGFR
signaling. ELDR binds to the purine-rich element-binding protein alpha (PURA) that is tumor suppressive
in GBM. ELDR-PURA binding prevents PURA from interacting with the proto-oncogene BMI1, thus
disrupting the PURA-BMI1 association in GSCs, and in so doing should increase BMI1/PRC1 oncogenic
activity. Importantly, nuclear ELDR is found enriched in the nuclear speckles (NS), a membrane-less
subcellular structure and a biomolecular condensate critical in cancer progression and chemoresistance,
and interacts with multiple proteins in the nucleus, mostly in NS, thus simultaneously modulating different
signaling and cellular processes. In this project, we plan to determine how the ELDR-PURA association
affects GBM biologic properties through affecting PURA-BMI1 interaction thereby regulating BMI1 activity,
assess effects of NS-enriched ELDR on GBM biologic properties, and determine whether specific targeting
of ELDR using antisense oligonucleotides (ASO), instead of inhibiting individual ELDR-effectors, enhances
therapeutic responses of GBM. This project will be the first to study a consequence of the EGFR locus
amplification in GBM through ELDR in GBM biology and therapeutic response. The results of this study
will not only advance our understanding of the importance of lncRNA expression in cancer, which has the
potential to influence global gene expression in normal and tumor cells, but also open the door to an
alternative strategy of targeting the well-characterized amplification of the EGFR locus in GBM.",Therapeutic Targeting in EGFR-amplified Glioblastoma,"NARRATIVE

"Weight status differences are present upon entry into kindergarten, indicating that the origins of
overweight/obesity (OWOB) develop before elementary school. Preschoolers (3-4-yr-olds) may also
experience accelerated weight gain (i.e., increased zBMI) during the summer and lose weight (i.e., decreased
zBMI) during the school year – indicating that summer may play a key role in developing OWOB. Preschoolers
from low-income households (i.e., 185% or less of poverty level or Medicaid eligible) are at the greatest risk for
accelerated summer weight gain. In general, we don’t know the places preschoolers go, who they are with, and
what they do during the summer that may influence their health behaviors and weight status. In the US, many
center-based childcares operate on an academic/school calendar (Aug-May), and 60-80% of preschoolers
attend center-based care. Preschoolers who attend formal center-based childcare are less likely to develop
OWOB by 1st grade compared to preschoolers who receive home-based care. We believe attending center-
based childcare lowers the risk of OWOB through daily rules/routines that promote healthy behaviors (e.g.,
PE/recess, healthy meals, consistent sleep schedules at home). Center-based care facilitates the acquisition of
motor skills and fosters executive functioning/self-regulation – key factors in the development of OWOB.
During summer, fewer than 30% of preschoolers attend center-based childcare. For many preschoolers,
especially those from lower-income households, summer may be an extended period away from formal center-
based childcare that promotes unhealthy behaviors, loss of motor skills, and loss of executive functioning,
which could lead to excessive weight gain. We will conduct an observational cohort, enrolling 3-4-yr-old
children attending needs-based (185% or less of poverty level or Medicaid eligible) center-based childcare
during the academic/school year and follow them for 2 years (2 school years and 2 summers) as they transition
from preschool into elementary school. Measures of anthropometrics, motor skills, and executive function will
be collected before school ends and upon return from summer vacation. Health behaviors (i.e., activity,
screentime, diet, and sleep) will be collected during April/May (school) and July (summer) along with
information about social- and setting-specific influences. The following aims will be addressed: Compare
longitudinal changes in anthropometrics (primary outcome), health behaviors (secondary outcomes), and
motor skills and executive function (tertiary outcomes) during school and summer; Identify individual,

"Summary/Abstract
All motor commands flow through motoneurons (MNs), which are probably the most thoroughly studied of all
spinal neurons. Perhaps the most striking result to emerge from the many studies of MNs is that
neuromodulatory input from the brainstem exerts an enormous impact on motoneuron excitability, via
monosynaptic synapses releasing either serotonin (5HT) or norepinephrine (NE). However, the primary focus
of studies of this fundamental transformation has been on slowly varying synaptic inputs. Consequently,
neuromodulatory actions on inputs with fast temporal dynamics remain poorly understood. This uncertainty at
the foundation of motor output is a major limitation. Rapid movements are obviously essential for normal motor
behavior. Furthermore, transient inputs, such as H-reflexes and transcranial magnetic stimuli, are fundamental
for understanding circuitry of sensorimotor systems in humans and other animals in both normal and
pathological states. Our overall goal is to determine how integration of dynamic synaptic inputs in MNs is
impacted by brainstem neuromodulatory input. The previous focus on slow/steady inputs likely occurred
because a primary target for the brainstem neuromodulatory systems is a persistent inward current (PIC) that
activates very slowly and, once fully active, is highly resistant to inactivation. Thus neuromodulatory facilitation
of PICs generates input amplification up to 5-fold and input prolongation up to 10 seconds or more, depending
on the level of 5HT or NE released by brainstem axons. The PIC however has two main components, one
mediated by Ca channels (CaPIC) and the other by Na channels (Na PIC). The CaPIC provides the slow, non-
inactivating behavior whereas the NaPIC is much faster activating and much less resistant to inactivation. 5HT
and NE also lower motoneuron recruitment thresholds (via actions on the spike voltage threshold) and greatly
alter the driving forces for excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (because the CaPIC strongly
depolarizes the dendrites). Together, the NaPIC, threshold reduction and driving force alteration mean that
dynamic inputs may be nearly as sensitive to neuromodulation as slow inputs. We will investigate these
neuromodulatory effects on MNs across the full range of temporal dynamics of input, from transient to steady.
We will deploy array electrode recordings on muscles to assess population firing patterns in Aim 1, in situ
voltage clamp techniques to elucidate cellular mechanisms in Aim 2. The transformation of cellular to
population behaviors will be investigated by realistic MN models implemented on a supercomputer in Aim 3.
Large differences in integration of slow versus fast inputs are likely to be fundamental for understanding normal
behavior and for interpretation of the strength of synaptic connections based on transient stimulation in
humans (H reflexes, TMS, etc) in both normal behaviors and neurological diseases and injuries.",Neuromodulation of motoneuronal processing of dynamic synaptic inputs,"Project Narrative
Despite intensive study of the actions of neuromodulatory systems on motoneurons, these actions on their
processing of transient and rapidly rising (i.e. dynamic) inputs are poorly understood. We propose systematic
study of this issue. Our results will be essential for understanding the genesis of rapid movements and the use
of transient inputs to identify functional connections in humans in both normal and pathological states.",https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10900058,Action Potentials;Affect;Animals;Axon;Behavior;Brain Stem;Cephalic;Custom;Data;Dendrites;Electrodes;Felis catus;Foundations;Goals;H-Reflex;Human;In Situ;Link;Location;Locomotion;Magnetism;Measures;Mediating;Modeling;Motor;Motor Neurons;Motor output;Movement;Muscle;Nervous System Disorder;Nervous System Trauma;Neurons;Norepinephrine;Output;Pathologic;Pattern;Population;Preparation;Probability;Property;Resistance;Role;Serotonin;Source;Speed;Spinal;Spinal Injuries;Stimulus;Synapses;Synaptic Potentials;System;Testing;Uncertainty;Voltage-Clamp Technics;driving force;experimental study;metaplastic cell transformation;motor behavior;neural;neuroregulation;postsynaptic;recruit;sensorimotor system;supercomputer;voltage,10900058,1R37NS135820-01A1,,,,,,,,"['action potentials', 'affect', 'animals', 'axon', 'behavior', 'brain stem', 'cephalic', 'custom', 'data', 'dendrites', 'electrodes', 'felis catus', 'foundations', 'goals', 'h-reflex', 'human', 'in situ', 'link', 'location', 'locomotion', 'magnetism', 'measures', 'mediating', 'modeling', 'motor', 'motor neurons', 'motor output', 'movement', 'muscle', 'nervous system disorder', 'nervous system trauma', 'neurons', 'norepinephrine', 'output', 'pathologic', 'pattern', 'population', 'preparation', 'probability', 'property', 'resistance', 'role', 'serotonin', 'source', 'speed', 'spinal', 'spinal injuries', 'stimulus', 'synapses', 'synaptic potentials', 'system', 'testing', 'uncertainty', 'voltage-clamp technics', 'driving force', 'experimental study', 'metaplastic cell transformation', 'motor behavior', 'neural', 'neuroregulation', 'postsynaptic', 'recruit', 'sensorimotor system', 'supercomputer', 'voltage']",,
"Abstract. Mosquitoes kill nearly half-a-million people each year. Due to lack of effective
vaccines for most mosquito-borne diseases, prevention of mosquito bites remains the primary
focus of disease mitigation. Larval surveillance - monitoring potential breeding sites to
understand larval species composition, abundance, and spatial distribution - is key to enabling
precision vector control. If medically relevant larvae are detected, targeted larvicide treatments
can eliminate the population prior to emergence as adult mosquitoes, when disease
transmission occurs. Unfortunately, due to its resource-intensive nature, few mosquito control
organizations (MCOs) have the capacity to conduct the full-process of larval surveillance with
identification to species. Technicians need to travel to the potential breeding site, collect
specimens, return to the lab for visual morphological identification under a microscope, and if
medically relevant species are found, return to the field for larvicide treatments. Delayed,
inaccurate, or missing larval species data can miss an opportunity for intervention prior to
emergence of adults, or misinform costly unnecessary treatment. While significant efforts have
been made to explore crowdsourcing larval data and unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) for rapid
assessments of potential breeding sites, implementation and technical challenges have limited
practical use of these approaches. No automated solutions exist to build larval species
identification capacities. We propose to develop the first commercially available image
recognition platform for operational larval surveillance of the 20 most relevant mosquito species
in the US. This proposal will first validate the optical requirements for species identification of
larvae. This will enable the development of a standardized imaging configuration that will be
used to build a high-quality image dataset of mosquito larvae of different species capturing
diagnostic morphological features. The image dataset will be used to train a computer vision
system to identify species of mosquito larvae. Ultimately the approaches developed here will
enable new larval surveillance products, from an identification field-tool to inform technician
larviciding at the point of specimen collection, to remote sensing systems that will continuously
monitor historical breeding sites and alert mosquito control organizations (MCOs) when
intervention is needed.",Automated identification of larval mosquito species with computer vision,"Project Narrative. The proposed project aims to develop a commercially available image
recognition platform for operational larval surveillance of medically relevant mosquito species,
initially capable of identification of 10 key species to Placer County, CA as initial proof of

an existing imaging device to achieve these requirements, building a high-quality image dataset
with the device, and training a computer vision system to identify mosquito larvae species. This
tool will enable mosquito control organizations to make same-day control decisions based on
larval surveillance data targeted to species of concern, leapfrogging conventional larval

Project Summary
Our understanding of how human adaptive immune responses are initiated, evolve over time, and become
durable have been shaped largely, although not exclusively, by what we have learned from measuring B and T
cells in the blood following immune perturbations with pathogens, vaccines and immune-modulating drugs. While
longitudinal analyses can be performed with blood samples, it is only possible to assess the recirculating immune
cells and we know that many antigen-experienced “memory” B and T cells rarely recirculate and reside in
peripheral and lymphoid tissues. Recent studies in animals reveal that immune memory cells in tissues play
important early roles in immune protection at barrier sites. The generation and maintenance of these cells are
controlled by different mechanisms and these tissue-residing memory cells are endowed with distinct phenotypic,
molecular, and functional programs. Although it is difficult to study human tissue-residing immune cells, the
elegant studies that have been done confirm that studying immune cells in tissues reveals additional complexity
that is not always captured in peripheral blood. However, to date, most human studies in peripheral tissues have
not evaluated the evolution or durability of antigen specific B and T cell responses in the face of a continuously
changing microenvironment and/or ongoing antigen exposure. This gap in knowledge limits our ability to
identify appropriate modalities to boost and maintain protective immune cells within peripheral tissues and to
prevent the development and persistence of potentially pathogenic immune cells that contribute to tissue
damage. This U19 addresses the knowledge gap by characterizing immune memory cells that reside in tissue
samples derived from transplant patients. The unifying goals of the three U19 projects are to better understand
the evolution of human immune memory responses in tissue and blood and to characterize the factors that
contribute to the persistence and durability of human memory T and B cells. To meet these goals, investigators
with complementary expertise in B and T cell biology, infectious disease, transplantation and autoimmunity will
work together to methodically interrogate the memory B and T cell compartments in transplanted kidney, uterus
and lung. The major objective of Core A is to provide financial, scientific and regulatory oversight and
administrative support for the overall Program as well as the individual projects and cores. We will achieve this
objective by: (i) supporting the scientific progress of the projects and cores, organizing the monthly research in
progress meetings and interfacing with the project and core team members to ensure needs are met; (ii)
organizing scientific interactions such as the annual retreat with the scientific advisory board, and the annual
Cooperative Centers on Human Immunology investigator meeting; (iii) providing financial oversight and

"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hypothesis-testing studies designed to understand the evolution and durability of B and T cell responses in the
contexts of alloreactivity, tissue residency and viral infection that are described in this proposal will rely on several
`omics and other data-rich approaches and corresponding analyses. To support use of these platforms and their
associated data analyses, we propose to provide unified and integrated data and informatics services in the
Data and Informatics Service Core (Core D). The core will cover two broad areas as reflected by the Specific
Aims: data management, including clinical data integration, and bioinformatic and statistical data analysis, both
primary (standardized pipelines) and downstream. In Specific Aim 1, we propose to oversee and implement data
management processes and systems applied to both raw and derived data as well as its integration with
corresponding clinical characteristics of human donors. These efforts will support raw-to-figure analytical
provenance and will benefit the Program by creating infrastructure that can be efficiently used by all the Projects
and Cores as well as promoting good data stewardship practices which in turn, support reproducibility. In Specific
Aim 2, we propose to implement standardized workflows to cover all of the high-throughput platforms used in
this Program (by one or more Projects and data generated by one or more Cores), including bulk B and T cell
receptor repertoire sequencing, single-cell sequencing applications (gene expression, VDJ, feature barcoding
for surface phenotyping and antigen specificity, spatial transcriptomics, multiome), analysis of antibody reactivity
profiles and other assays. This will benefit the Program by standardizing primary data processing across the
Projects and will promote comparability of results. Additionally, we will provide collaborative downstream
bioinformatics, analytical and statistical support for all three Projects. This will benefit the Program by serving as
a resource that all Investigators in the Projects can access for using data analyses to address their hypotheses,
and by centralizing this function, we will economize this support as the analytical needs and methodologies of
the Projects will overlap. To develop this Core, we have assembled a strong team with experienced leadership
and talented individuals with demonstrated expertise in all of the areas covered. Combining these two broad
areas into a Core will maximize efficiency, standardize processes, and promote scientific synergy across the
Program.",Core D: Data and Informatics Service Core,,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10824855,Address;Allogenic;Antibodies;Antigen Receptors;Antigens;Area;Autoantibodies;B-Lymphocytes;B-cell receptor repertoire sequencing;Bar Codes;Bioinformatics;Biological Assay;Biometry;Cell Separation;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Data;Cloning;Collaborations;Computer software;Consumption;Data;Data Analyses;Data Analytics;Data Reporting;Data Set;Deposition;Documentation;Elements;Environment;Evolution;FAIR principles;Flow Cytometry;Gene Expression;Genetic Transcription;Genomics;Goals;Human;Human Characteristics;Human Resources;Immune;Immune response;Immunology procedure;Individual;Informatics;Infrastructure;Investigation;Leadership;Link;Lung Transplantation;Metadata;Methodology;Modality;Names;Nature;Phenotype;Play;Procedures;Process;Production;Publications;Reagent;Recording of previous events;Reproducibility;Research;Research Design;Research Personnel;Residencies;Resources;Role;Running;Serology;Services;Specificity;Standardization;Statistical Data Interpretation;Surface;System;T cell receptor repertoire sequencing;T cell response;T-Cell Receptor;T-Lymphocyte;Talents;Testing;Tissues;Validation;Virus Diseases;Visualization;Work;biophysical analysis;complex data;computerized data processing;data analysis pipeline;data hub;data integration;data management;data pipeline;data quality;data sharing;data standards;experience;experimental study;health record;large datasets;multidimensional data;multiple data types;multiple omics;programs;public repository;response;single cell sequencing;single-cell RNA sequencing;software development;symposium;synergism;transcriptomics,10824855,1U19AI181105-01,,,,,,,,"['address', 'allogenic', 'antibodies', 'antigen receptors', 'antigens', 'area', 'autoantibodies', 'b-lymphocytes', 'b-cell receptor repertoire sequencing', 'bar codes', 'bioinformatics', 'biological assay', 'biometry', 'cell separation', 'cells', 'clinical', 'clinical data', 'cloning', 'collaborations', 'computer software', 'consumption', 'data', 'data analyses', 'data analytics', 'data reporting', 'data set', 'deposition', 'documentation', 'elements', 'environment', 'evolution', 'fair principles', 'flow cytometry', 'gene expression', 'genetic transcription', 'genomics', 'goals', 'human', 'human characteristics', 'human resources', 'immune', 'immune response', 'immunology procedure', 'individual', 'informatics', 'infrastructure', 'investigation', 'leadership', 'link', 'lung transplantation', 'metadata', 'methodology', 'modality', 'names', 'nature', 'phenotype', 'play', 'procedures', 'process', 'production', 'publications', 'reagent', 'recording of previous events', 'reproducibility', 'research', 'research design', 'research personnel', 'residencies', 'resources', 'role', 'running', 'serology', 'services', 'specificity', 'standardization', 'statistical data interpretation', 'surface', 'system', 't cell receptor repertoire sequencing', 't cell response', 't-cell receptor', 't-lymphocyte', 'talents', 'testing', 'tissues', 'validation', 'virus diseases', 'visualization', 'work', 'biophysical analysis', 'complex data', 'computerized data processing', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data hub', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data pipeline', 'data quality', 'data sharing', 'data standards', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'health record', 'large datasets', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple data types', 'multiple omics', 'programs', 'public repository', 'response', 'single cell sequencing', 'single-cell rna sequencing', 'software development', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'transcriptomics']",,
"PROJECT SUMMARY
Project 3: Evolution, dynamics and durability of B cell and antibody responses in lung transplantation
Emerging data suggest that, like lung-resident memory T cells, memory B cells can reside in the lung without
recirculating and act as first responders to pulmonary pathogens like influenza and SARS-CoV-2. We termed
these cells lung-resident memory B cells or BRM cells. We also showed that lung-resident memory B cells require
contact with antigen within the lung in order to initiate their residency program. Taken together, these data
suggest that BRM cells are an important component of immunity to pulmonary pathogens. However we have
only a rudimentary understanding of where BRM cells come from, how they are selected, what antigens they
react with and how they are recalled (or not) after vaccination or secondary infection. Although lung-resident
memory B cells are clearly generated in response to pulmonary infection, it is less clear whether they are
generated in response to other types of antigens like auto-antigens or allo-antigens. Interestingly, many
pulmonary diseases, like COPD, IPF and ILD, have an autoimmune component in some patients, perhaps as a
consequence of persistent inflammation. Moreover, allo-reactive antibodies are often observed in lung transplant
patients. Given that auto-antigens and allo-antigens are widely expressed in the lung tissue, it makes sense that
lung-resident B cells will respond to these antigens in the lung. Our overall hypothesis is that allo-reactive, auto-
reactive and pathogen-reactive B cells in lung allografts are primed and selected locally in the lung, and that the
signals and cellular interactions involved in this process are different than those in conventional secondary
lymphoid organs. To test this hypothesis, we will take advantage of single cell methods that allow us to define
(and compare) individual B cells in blood, bronchalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung tissue by a combination of
transcriptome (single cell RNseq), BCR clonotype (single cell BCRseq), DNA-barcoded antibodies to surface
markers (CITEseq) and affinity/specificity/cross-reactivity of BCRs cloned and expressed as recombinant
antibodies (single cell cloning). We will also use high-dimensional antigen arrays of HLA alleles, auto-antigens,
and virus-derived antigens to quantify the reactivity of antibodies in the blood and BAL fluid of lung transplant
patients. Using these methods to compare populations of auto-reactive, allo-reactive and virus-reactive-specific
B cells in the lung, BAL and blood over time and, in some cases, after infection, we will be able to determine how
memory B cells in the lung are related to one another, the depth of their selection, the extent of their cross-
reactivity and their ability to respond to local antigens. This information will be informative about the evolution of
donor-specific antibodies in the context of lung transplant, the potential role of auto-antibodies in the lungs of
transplant patients and the ability of pre-formed, virus-reactive (DONOR) B cells retained in donor lungs as they
respond to infection.","Project 3: Evolution, dynamics and durability of B cell and antibody responses in lung transplantation",,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10824859,2019-nCoV;Affinity;Alleles;Alloantigen;Allografting;Antibodies;Antibody Response;Antigens;Appearance;Autoantibodies;Autoantigens;Autoimmune;B-Lymphocytes;B-cell receptor repertoire sequencing;Bar Codes;Binding;Blood;Cells;Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing;Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease;Clone Cells;DNA;Data;Development;Epitopes;Evolution;Functional disorder;Genetic Transcription;Human;Immunity;Immunoglobulin A;Immunoglobulin G;Individual;Infection;Inflammation;Influenza;Irrigation;Liquid substance;Location;Longevity;Lung;Lung Diseases;Lung Lavage Fluid;Lung Transplantation;Lung infections;Memory B-Lymphocyte;Methods;Monitor;Mus;Pathology;Patients;Population;Process;Reaction;Recombinant Antibody;Residencies;Respiratory Tract Infections;Role;Serum;Signal Transduction;Site;Specificity;Structure of parenchyma of lung;Surface;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Time;Tissues;Transplant Recipients;Transplantation;Vaccination;Variant;Virus;antibody-mediated rejection;autoreactive B cell;autoreactivity;cross reactivity;donor-specific antibody;experimental study;first responder;high dimensionality;influenzavirus;insight;lung allograft;lung pathogen;migration;pathogen;programs;respiratory virus;response;secondary infection;secondary lymphoid organ;self-renewal;single-cell RNA sequencing;tissue resident memory T cell;transcriptome;transcriptome sequencing,10824859,1U19AI181105-01,severe acute respiratory syndrome,3,0.3,0.22,fals,,"evolution, dynamics and durability of b cell and antibody responses in lung transplantation

"Vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID), a type of cognitive disorder mainly induced by
cerebrovascular pathology and dysfunction, is widely recognized as the second most common cause of
dementia after Alzheimer’s disease, and results in tremendous economic and social burdens on our society.
Despite recent progress in VCID research, our understanding of cerebrovascular contributions to the
pathogenesis of VCID is still limited, and the effective therapeutic approaches for VCID are unavailable.
 Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) function as a novel class of noncoding RNAs that modulate gene or
protein expression. Cumulative studies have documented that lncRNAs are involved in many important
biological processes as well as implicated in regulating the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular diseases.
However, the functional significance and molecular mechanisms of lncRNA molecules in regulating
cerebrovascular pathogenesis and the progression of cognitive decline are totally unknown in VCID.
 In our recent preliminary studies, we have shown that the expression of a lncRNA, metastasis associated
lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (Malat1), is significantly increased in mouse cerebral vasculature after
chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH)-induced VCID. Of note, genetic deletion of Malat1 displayed increased
cognitive impairment, white matter injury, and neuronal loss in the experimental VCID mouse model, whereas
EC-selective Malat1 transgenic overexpression resulted in reduced cognitive impairment. Mechanistically, we
have documented that Malat1 genetic deficiency increased BBB permeability in mice after VCID. Moreover,
loss-of-Malat1 function by LNA-GapmeR significantly increased proinflammatory cytokines (MCP-1, E-selectin)
and reduced the expression of VE-cadherin and ZO-1 in primary brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs)
after oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). These findings have provided the basis for our Central Hypothesis
that vascular Malat1 ameliorates white and grey matter injury and inhibits long-term cognitive decline
in CCH-induced VCID through maintaining BBB integrity and reducing endothelial inflammation to
improve the brain microenvironment. Three specific aims will be performed in this proposal. Aim 1: Define
the role of vascular Malat1 in long-term cognitive disorders, brain white matter injury, and neuronal loss in
experimental VCID; Aim 2: Elucidate the mechanisms of vascular Malat1-mediated brain protection in VCID;
Aim 3: Explore systematic delivery of the Malat1 activator polydatin as a potential therapy in VCID. Elucidating
Malat1 cerebrovascular protection will enable us to discover the vascular contribution to brain white and grey
matter injury and dementia, and lead us to develop novel and effective lncRNA-based treatment against VCID.",Long non-coding RNAs mediate white and grey matter integrity in vascular cognitive impairment and dementia,"PROJECT NARRATIVE
 Vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) is the second most common cause of dementia after
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and development of effective therapies is urgently required. The object of this

"Project Summary
The anterior lobe of the cerebellum has unique sensitivities in developmental and
degenerative disorders. How anterior and posterior compartments are differentiated
developmentally are not adequately understood. The classical mouse mutation meander
tail (mea) causes both the kinked tail for which it is named and a compartment-specific
disorganization of the anterior cerebellum. Three independent alleles have been reported.
Positional cloning efforts more than a decade ago identified a genomic interval but failed
to identify causal variants due to technical limitations. Data from that project and from
genome-scale mutagenesis projects highly suggest a recurrent regulatory mutation
involving one or more structural genes adjacent to the mapped location. This exploratory
proposal will identify mutations underlying the two extant mea alleles and test the
molecular sequelae of mea mutation on anterior compartment identity and development
using cutting-edge genomic tools. The mea locus has been studied for nearly 50 years,
but molecular identification eluded efforts with earlier technology. We will resolve this
genetic puzzle using de novo long read sequencing, layered onto previously unpublished
mapping data. We propose that mea mutations are regulatory in nature and affect
compartmentation or compartment-specific identity with respect in the anterior cerebellar
lobe. This predicts either discrete or graded changes in expression signatures within or
across compartments. We will test this family of hypotheses using single nucleus
sequencing of RNA and transposon-accessible chromatin sites from mutant and control
littermates in a highly congenic background. Together these aims will resolve a
longstanding mystery in the genetics of cerebellum development and point to plausible
mechanisms for pleiotropic effects on vertebral development.",Meander tail and development of the anterior lobe.,"Project Narrative: The anterior lobe of the cerebellum is an important locus in several neurological

"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This project will assess a deep learning approach for predicting the effects of genetic variants on chromatin
accessibility (CA). Currently, there is a knowledge gap in understanding the function and causality of genetic
variants in human genetics research since over 90% of genetic variants have been found within the non-coding
region of the genome. GWAS studies have provided us with information about these genetic variant
associations. However, this research has yet to establish the molecular function of these genetic variants.
Molecular quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis has been used to determine variant function, and the
identification of variants associated with molecular traits such as caQTLs. However, due to linkage
disequilibrium, the identification of causal variants found from molecular QTL analysis is ambiguous; thus, they
lack the power to identify associations with rare genetic variants. Furthermore, it has been shown that
allelic-specific information, including allele-specific chromatin accessibility (ASCA), can increase the power to
detect caQTLs, potentially improving machine learning model predictions. An alternative approach to
determining variant function are machine learning methods, which have been utilized to determine the
molecular function of genetic variants and have achieved success at predicting gene expression, CA, and
transcription factor binding from DNA sequence. However, these machine learning models are solely trained
on reference genome sequences and do not consider human genetic variation. The key focus of this research
proposal is to investigate the hypothesis that a machine learning model that utilizes genetic variation and
allele-specific information will accurately predict the effects of both common and rare genetic variants on
chromatin accessibility. To investigate this hypothesis, here are two specific aims: Aim 1 will develop a
variant-aware neural network to predict the effect of genetic variants on CA. Aim 2 will predict the function of
rare genetic variants. In summary, this proposal strives to establish improved predictions of the molecular
function of genetic variants found in the non-coding region of the genome by assessing the utility of genetic
variation and ASCA with a deep learning approach. The proposed study will lead to the ability to predict the
function of rare genetic variants, which are likely to be highly important to disease traits, but whose function
cannot currently be uncovered utilizing QTL-based methods. This training plan will provide the applicant the
opportunity to (1) develop expertise in machine learning in genomics, (2) gain skills in CRISPR-based genome
editing, (3) improve scientific writing and communication skills, and (4) develop mentoring and teaching
aptitude. These professional training goals will provide the applicant with the essential training and scientific
experience required to obtain a postdoctoral fellowship and thereafter become an impactful independent
research investigator at an R1 University.",Predicting the effects of genetic variants on chromatin accessibility with a deep learning approach,"PROJECT NARRATIVE

"SUMMARY
Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and lethal brain cancer is notorious for wide dissemination in the brain.
Understanding cellular and molecular underpinnings of GBM invasion is thus critical. While earlier research has
made progress on intrinsic drivers of cell motility, how GBM cells meet the challenge of extrinsic factors such as
physical constraints to negotiate narrow paths through the brain parenchyma remains unclear. Our preliminary
studies have revealed that endocytosis at the front of migrating cells is a critical process for membrane dynamics
during confined migration. Furthermore, our new data have also implicated alteration of the negative electric
charge at the inner membrane surface as a key organizer of cytoskeletal activity of migrating GBM cells in
confined space. These novel preliminary findings were made possible by applying new microchannel devices
coupled with live-cell imaging and advanced fluorescent probes to study GBM confined migration. In this
exploratory R21 proposal, we will conduct mechanistic studies to test the hypothesis that membrane dynamics
and membrane surface charge via mechanoelectric coupling are key drivers of confined GBM migration. In Aim
1, we will investigate how membrane dynamics mediated by endocytosis facilitates GBM confined migration. We
will conduct functional assays to assess how specific endocytosis inhibitors impact membrane dynamics and
migratory capacity of invading GBM cells through microchannels. In parallel, we will perform in vivo GBM
transplants for proof-of-principle efficacy studies of limiting endocytosis to curb invasive spread of GBM. In Aim
2, we will explore the emerging concept of surface membrane charge and mechanoelectrical coupling for
confined GBM migration. We will test the hypothesis that change of electrical charge at the inner leaflet of plasma
membrane (by anionic lipids or membrane-associated proteins) bestows GBM cells with increased migratory
capacity through organization of cytoskeletal activity. We will first generate novel molecular reagents to either
increase or decrease surface charge in an inducible manner and test the impact on GBM confined migration.
We will apply the microchannel devices for high-resolution live-cell imaging to monitor the effects of altering
membrane charges on actin network, calcium flux, and endocytosis-mediated plasma membrane dynamics. We
will then conduct proof-of concept in vivo GBM transplant studies to examine the efficacy of these novel
molecular agents to impede GBM invasion. Together, our studies will provide mechanistic insight and conceptual
advance on membrane plasticity and mechanoelectrical membrane dynamics for confined migration of GBM
cells and their impact on GBM invasiveness in vivo. It will open translational opportunities to impede GBM spread
and recurrence. We will also make the innovative microchannel devices available for the wider research
community, thus accelerating the research of cancer mechanobiology and tumor invasion.",Novel mechanisms of confined migration of GBM cells,"PROJECT NARRATIVE

"Project Summary
Developing an effective HIV vaccine to curb HIV infections is a global urgency. Env is the sole target for broadly
neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs), and is the focus of vaccination strategies. One barrier to a protective HIV
vaccine is the dense array of glycans that covers the surface of the Env spike restricting the immunogenicity of
Env proteins. There are ~90 individual glycan sites per trimer and each site can be decorated with high-mannose,
hybrid or complex-type glycans. These glycans are crucial for various Env functions including its conformation,
antigenicity, immunogenicity and the ability of HIV to evade humoral responses. The presence/absence and type
of glycans on Env-based vaccine candidates can influence both antigenicity and immunogenicity of the protein.
Most bNAbs include Env glycans as part of their binding epitope, making the glycosylation of Env a key aspect
of HIV-1 vaccine design. These bNAbs has been isolated from chronically HIV-1 infected individuals but induction
of such bNAbs by vaccination has not been successful yet. Thus, Env immunogens that display glycan and
antigenic profile matching those present on the virus may have a better prospect at inducing a cross-neutralizing
Ab response. However, a clear understanding of what comprise the site-specific glycan make-up of virus-
associated Env is missing, particularly for clinically relevant isolates being pursued for human vaccine trials. The
mechanisms/factors that regulate the Env glycan pattern and composition are not understood. This information
is critical for improving Env as immunogens and for understanding the optimal epitopes of glycan-dependent
bNAbs. The proposed study aims to fill this gap in knowledge by investigating Env biogenesis and glycosylation
that starts in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) compartment of the host cells and continues to be modified in Golgi.
A better understanding of the processes that are involved in the ER and Golgi will provide us with the tools that
can be used to generate Env immunogens with native antigenic and glycosylation profiles. The overarching goal
of the proposed study is to 1) characterize the site-specific glycosylation of native Env on virus, 2) investigate
the processes in the ER and Golgi that regulate and imprint the type of glycans on HIV Env, 3) identify ways to
express Env with glycans that match virus-associated Env, 4) characterize how native glycans impact the
structural and conformational flexibility of Env, and, 5) evaluate the immunogenicity of these Env in animal
models for their capacity to elicit cross-neutralizing antibodies. This study will take advantage of several
innovative technologies such as LC-MS/MS, HDX-MS along with the complementary expertise of the investigator
team to accomplish the goals. Successful completion of the study will reveal several new and unknown aspects
of protein synthesis and mechanisms that can be applied towards the development of improved Env
immunogens for HIV vaccines.",Harnessing native glycosylation to improve immunogenicity of HIV-1 Env immunogens,"Project Narrative:
HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Env) are the only viral antigens exposed to the host environment and are the
main targets for therapeutic and prophylactic measures to control HIV-1 infection. The Env is heavily glycosylated
and these glycans influence both immunogenicity and antigenicity of the protein; making Env glycans a major
component of vaccine design. This study will identify the site-specific glycosylation of native HIV-1 Env and
identify mechanisms that can be applied to engineer Env immunogens with correct glycosylation, native epitope

to replace OBOD with CBCS, representing an important inflection point in energetic waste management
that requires surveillance to ensure that community exposures are sufficiently minimized. However, even
CBCS may incur risks. Emissions of chlorinated compounds and some metals associated with thyroid,
respiratory, and skin disease are still anticipated with CBCS. For this reason, Colfax residents have asked us to
continue surveillance of the air quality even after the cessation of OBOD. We hypothesize that replacement
of OBOD with CBCS will cause short-term increases in coarse PM containing perchlorate derivatives,
transition metals, and PFAS during construction, followed by a substantial reduction in fine PM and its
components once CBCS is operational. Through our work, we will 1) collect ambient particulate matter,
household dust, and biological samples at key time periods during and after construction of the CBCS and 2)
chemically analyze collected samples to ascertain changes in chemical composition during OBOD operationand
the CBCS construction and operation phases. These efforts will allow for ongoing quantification of air pollution
to assess risk of oxidative stress and health effects from exposures, leading to timely reporting of risk data to the
community. The proposed study is time-sensitive, as it provides a rare opportunity to compare the
emissions and exposures during operations of different technologies and during the transitional period
of demolition and construction. This unique dataset will demonstrate the effectiveness and impact of
operational changes to TT, providing crucial information about reduction in concentrations and exposures
following cessation of TT. This information will be essential for management of military wastes throughout
the U.S. to reduce exposures to chemicals associated with many preventable health conditions.","Changes in Exposures to PFAS, Metals, Dioxins, and Furans following Cessation of Open Burning of Munitions Wastes at a Hazardous Waste Thermal Treatment Facility","This time-sensitive research study characterizes changes in airborne particulate matter (PM) and its constituents

"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The abnormal aggregation of transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) in neuronal
inclusions is the defining pathologic hallmark of approximately half of frontotemporal lobar degeneration cases
(FTLD-TDP). Substantial heterogeneity exists in the clinical disorders associated with FTLD-TDP, which
reflects regional differences in neurodegeneration. Neuropathologic studies have suggested that the regional
cortical burden of aggregated TDP-43 may be responsible for neurodegeneration and ensuing clinical
heterogeneity. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the region-specific accumulation of aggregated
TDP-43 are not understood. We hypothesize that: 1) in view of the subdivision of FTLD-TDP Types (A-D) and
variability in limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC),
presence of atypical neuropathologic features may signal novel TDP-43 structures and post-translational
modifications (PTMs); 2) among TDP-43 proteinopathies, each neuropathologic phenotype is related to a
distinct structure of TDP-43 filaments, TDP-43 PTMs, and seeding properties. To investigate these
hypotheses, we propose to combine our collective expertise in neuropathology, molecular genetics, molecular
characterization of misfolded proteins, fluorescent multiplex immunohistochemistry, digital spatial profiling,
quantitative digital image analysis, and cryo-electron microscopy to study our study population, which includes
clinicopathologically well-characterized cases from the Dementia Laboratory’s Brain Library and cases from
other researchers. The project specific aims provide a foundation for in-depth analysis of TDP-43
proteinopathies. Aim 1 combines innovative neuropathologic methods for mapping TDP-43 inclusions,
misfolded TDP-43 in different neuronal and glial populations, glial response, and for determining how TDP-43
amyloid folds relate to the phenotype. Aim 2 leverages cutting-edge technology to identify novel PTMs that
coexist with the presence of misfolded TDP-43. RT-QuIC assay might reveal differences of TDP-43 seeding
properties. Aim 3 uses the most advanced cryo-EM technology to determine the structures of the TDP-43
amyloid filaments.","Investigating the role of TDP-43 mislocalization, structure, and post-translational modifications in the neuropathologically heterogeneous TDP-43 proteinopathies","PROJECT NARRATIVE

"SUMMARY
Inflammation, dysregulated innate immune responses, and loss of barrier function underlie several skin
conditions including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, hidradenitis suppurativa, and pachyonychia congenita.
Compelling evidence now shows that signals regulating inflammation and innate immunity are produced and
secreted by stressed keratinocytes making up the skin epidermis. How the relevant signals are generated in
keratinocytes, their cellular targets, and the pathways involved in ensuring proper regulation of inflammation
and innate immunity in healthy skin tissue, and their dysregulation in disease, remain poorly understood.
This multi-PI proposal takes advantage of the complementary expertise of two established investigators and
is supported by a strong body of unpublished findings, obtained collaboratively, showing that (i) keratinocyte-
derived and keratin-dependent signals regulate the spatial and temporal pattern of neutrophil influx into skin
undergoing sterile inflammation; (ii) keratinocytes transiently adapt to prior exposures and are able to amplify
responses in the setting of repeated aggressions; (iii) the stress response keratin 17 (K17) acts as a positive
regulator of neutrophil infiltration by mediating the sustained activity of protein kinase C a (PKCa) in
activated keratinocytes; and (iv) keratin 16 (K16) - another stress response keratin – acts as a negative
regulator of neutrophil infiltration and inflammation. We hypothesize that stressed keratinocyte-derived
signals engage and regulate cellular effector of innate immunity in skin, and that this is highly relevant to
several inflammatory skin disorders. We further hypothesize that K16 and K17 act through unique cis-acting
determinants to differentially regulate PKCa activity, neutrophil infiltration and other aspects of innate
immunity in stressed skin tissue. The proposal tests these hypotheses through three specific aims. Aim 1
seeks to compare the spatiotemporal pattern of immune cell infiltration and PKCa activity in mouse skin null
for either keratin 16 or 17 following exposure to stressors. These animals studies will be corroborated by
studies in N-TERT human keratinocytes in culture. Aim 2 seeks to identify, in cell culture models, the cis-
acting determinants responsible for the differential impact of K16 and K17 protein on PKCa activity,
neutrophil stimulation and other cellular aspects of inflammation and innate immunity. Finally, Aim 3 will
define the contribution of other key cellular effectors of innate immunity, specifically macrophages, in
mediating the keratinocyte- and keratin-dependent amplification of neutrophil influx in stressed skin in vivo.
The mechanistic insight that we stand to gain from completing this project is predicted to lead to a deeper
understanding of the pathophysiology of chronic skin inflammatory disorders, yield novel and more reliable
biomarkers and, possibly, new strategies to treat skin diseases.",Keratinocyte-dependent regulation of innate immune responses in inflamed skin,"PROJECT NARRATIVE

"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Among the 10.6 million persons estimated to develop tuberculosis (TB) disease each year, ~40% are never
notified to public health programs, leading to delays in treatment and increased TB transmission and mortality.
Current diagnostics for pulmonary TB require microbiologic testing of sputum specimens, which is often
unavailable in primary care settings in low- and middle-income countries, where most TB disease occurs.
Further, clinicians lack reliable measures of TB disease severity and treatment response, limiting their ability to
individualize treatment regimens and duration. There is a tremendous need for rapid, point-of-care, biomarker-
based tests that can be performed on easily obtained clinical samples (e.g., blood or urine) to diagnose TB
disease and monitor response to treatment. However, the lack of effective TB biomarkers is a critical limitation
to developing a new generation of point-of-care TB diagnostics. To address key knowledge gaps, this research
will examine the use of high-resolution plasma immunometabolic profiling, defined as simultaneous measurement
of plasma metabolites, oxylipins, and cytokines, to discover plasma molecular biomarker signatures with potential
for translation to point-of-care tests to diagnose and manage TB disease. The Specific Aims of this proposal are
to: (1) determine the plasma immunometabolic biomarker signatures that most accurately identify persons with
pulmonary TB disease in a population of adults referred for TB evaluation; (2) determine the accuracy of plasma
immunometabolic signatures to assess disease severity in persons with pulmonary TB; and (3) determine
whether plasma immunometabolic signatures can predict treatment response and risk of relapse in persons with
TB disease. The aims of this project will be achieved by enrolling a cohort of patients at the time of TB diagnosis
and following them prospectively during treatment and for 1-year post-TB treatment. Plasma immunometabolic
signatures will be compared in persons with pulmonary TB disease versus persons with TB symptoms in whom a
diagnosis of TB is ultimately excluded. We will further elucidate plasma molecular signatures associated with
pulmonary TB disease severity as measured by the extent of lung involvement of disease including cavitation on
computed tomography imaging of the chest. Serial plasma samples will be measured during TB treatment to
determine the molecular signatures that predict time to sputum culture conversion, as well as treatment failure
and relapse. The analyses will include multiple modeling strategies to select the plasma biomarkers that most
accurately identify each clinical outcome, with validation in banked plasma samples from geographically diverse
TB cohorts. This proposal will directly address the lack of effective clinical TB biomarkers to improve TB
diagnostics and promote a precision medicine approach to TB treatment by identifying markers of disease
severity and treatment response. The long-term goal of the proposed work is to create point-of-care tests based
on host immunometabolic biomarker signatures that allow clinicians in practice settings without a laboratory to
diagnose TB disease, assess disease severity, and monitor response to treatment.",Immunometabolic Biomarkers to Advance TB Diagnosis and Treatment Monitoring,"PROJECT NARRATIVE

"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) develops in more than 50% of youth with type 2 diabetes (T2D) as they transition
to young adulthood. Early identification of youth at risk of DKD, either due to environmental or biological factors,
has the potential to inform clinical care and alter the course of disease. Despite the substantial burden of DKD
in youth with T2D, however, modifiable risk factors and effective therapies remain limited. Emerging evidence
links per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a group of ubiquitous artificial chemicals used for more than
60 years in consumer and industrial products, with impaired kidney function, worse glucose regulation, and
higher levels of uremic toxins, key risk factors for DKD in youth with T2D. This study proposes to perform the
first prospective study to examine the association of PFAS exposure with DKD risk in youth with T2D and to
investigate potential biological mechanisms by integrating key information on metabolites and protein levels. The
project will build upon existing health and omics data (metabolomics and proteomics) in the Treatment Options
for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) study, a longitudinal study of youth with T2D who
underwent annual measures of kidney function for an average of 10.2 years. Using archived plasma samples,
this project will measure levels of 10 common PFAS and up to 250 novel and emerging PFAS at baseline. Due
to the long biological half-lives of most of these chemicals, single PFAS measures are a good proxy for medium
to long-term PFAS exposures. Analyses will examine associations between individual PFAS and PFAS mixtures
with risk and progression of DKD using survival analysis and mixture methods. To examine the potential
biological pathways that link PFAS exposure with DKD, analyses will then examine associations of PFAS
(individual and mixtures) with metabolites and proteins potentially associated with DKD risk. Further, a novel
latent unknown clustering approach will be applied to comprehensively analyze PFAS exposure, multiomics, and
clinical data to identify subgroups of youth with T2D at high risk of DKD. These research findings will contribute
to the body of evidence needed to inform PFAS regulation and develop innovative environmental health
interventions to detect and prevent DKD in youth with T2D. The culmination of my scientific training has prepared
me to successfully carry out the proposed K01 research. Through a multifaceted training plan supported by a
strong transdisciplinary mentoring and advisory team, this K01 will provide the necessary support for me to
further develop as an independent environmental health researcher. In addition to the proposed research project,
a robust yet attainable training plan incorporating didactic instruction, seminars, conferences, and mentorship
will prepare me to successfully complete a future NIEHS R01 to examine personalized DKD prevention strategies
in young individuals, when potential lesions may still be reversible, to promote healthier lives in this at-risk
population.",PFAS and Diabetic Kidney Disease in Young Onset Type 2 Diabetes: Emerging Risk Factors and Underlying Mechanisms,"PROJECT NARRATIVE
Youth-onset type 2 diabetes significantly contributes to the increasing prevalence of diabetic kidney disease,
yet our understanding of modifiable risk factors remains limited. This study seeks to explore the role of
exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), an emerging environmental risk factor, in the onset
and progression of diabetic kidney disease among youth with type 2 diabetes by integrating data on PFAS

"PROJECT SUMMARY
In this project, we propose to develop primary and secondary lead small molecules into preclinical drug
candidates for a precision SYNGAP1-DEE therapy. This research is consistent with the mission of NIMH
because this genetic disorder impacts mental health and behavior through impairments in intellectual and
social adaptive functioning. Pathogenic SYNGAP1 variants may explain up to 1% of non-X-linked
neurodevelopmental disorder cases and the estimated prevalence of these mutations is similar to that of
Fragile X syndrome, or 1-4/10,000 live births. Most, if not all, SYNGAP1-DEE cases are caused by variants
that lead to genetic haploinsufficiency (i.e. 50% of normal protein levels). Therefore, a rational strategy to treat
these patients is to develop precision-based approaches that “boost” low SynGAP protein expression in
affected brain cells. In prior NIMH funded research, we developed a novel phenotypic screening platform,
NDD-ChemScreen, which can detect chemical and biological agents that raise target gene/protein expression
in haploinsufficient neurons. This platform was used to discover lead small molecule compounds that
substantially raise SynGAP protein. Small molecules have distinct advantages compared to other
approaches for genetic disorders that impact central nervous system function. They can regulate disease-
driving biology, be delivered orally and still concentrate in brain tissue, and dosing can be easily adjusted
to fit individual patient needs and rapidly respond to adverse effects. While these compounds currently work
well in vitro, here we will optimize through established preclinical drug development workflows. This U01
research project has three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will focus on optimizing the primary lead, SR-1815,
through medicinal chemistry. We will perform extensive SAR on SR-1815 to optimize potency, efficacy,
brain penetrance, solubility, and other drug-like properties (e.g., microsomal stability, CYP inhibition) to
reach a primary optimized lead. Specific Aim 2 will focus on identifying and optimizing a secondary lead
series for SYNGAP1-DEE with a chemical scaffold that is distinct from the primary lead. This will de-risk
the overall development of small molecules for SYNGAP1-DEE by mitigating unforeseen dead-ends that
can occur during development of any given chemical scaffold. Specific Aim 3 will focus on scale-up and
early-stage preclinical development of one optimized lead compound (i.e. the best of the primary or
secondary optimized leads). This aim will including in vitro safety pharmacology testing and end with non-
GLP dose-range finding studies in two species to determine tolerability and safety. The end result of this
project will be a preclinical candidate ready for IND-enabling studies, which will be a launch pad for subsequent
clinical research projects aimed at improving the quality of life for patients diagnosed with SYNGAP1-DEE.",Preclinical development of a precision therapy for a monogenic mental health disorder,"PROJECT NARRATIVE

"Abstract: Dry mouth (xerostomia) is one of the most common and severe toxicities that patients
experience after radiotherapy (RT) for head and neck cancer. Xerostomia results from RT-induced
damage to the salivary glands and is associated with difficulties in chewing, swallowing, speaking,
as well as increases in occurrence of dental carries, all decreasing the patient’s quality of life.
Existing methods to prevent xerostomia are often not very helpful to the patient, difficult to
implement, and can cause additional toxicities. In an attempt to reduce the morbidity of treatment,
dose-reduced chemoradiotherapy regimens where patients with favorable-risk HPV-associated
tumors are treated with 60Gy (Chera 2019) compared to the conventional 70Gy have been
introduced. While dose reduction has led to an overall improved symptom profile, xerostomia
remained the most severe patient-reported toxicity. Thus, additional methods to minimize RT-
induced xerostomia are needed. Data suggest that salivary stem/progenitor cells, which
preferentially reside within the large salivary ducts, have the potential to regenerate salivary
glands post-injury. Our hypothesis is that dose sparing of the stem cells within the parotid ducts
will improve patient outcomes compared to conventional parotid sparing (i.e., attempting to limit
the mean dose of the contralateral parotid gland to less than 26Gy). In order to evaluate the utility
of parotid ductal sparing formally, we will conduct a randomized double-blind trial. Patients with
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas will be randomized to receive parotid ductal sparing
(using MRI-sialography to identify the ducts) or conventional parotid sparing RT.",A Phase II Randomized Assessment of Sparing Parotid Ducts via MRI Sialography for Reduced Patient Reported Xerostomia,"Narrative Study Description

"Human memory B and T cells (Bmem, Tmem) can be found in circulation and residing in lymphoid and non-
lymphoid tissues. After infection and vaccination, we can follow antigen (Ag)-specific phenotypically-defined
memory cells in blood, but we can't easily track Ag-specific clones of memory cells in blood over time and the
cells are lost to us if they leave circulation and move into tissues. Our knowledge of the antigen (Ag)-specific
Tmem and Bmem compartments in tissues, particularly non-lymphoid tissues, has been largely limited to single
timepoint analyses. While we have learned much about the human immune system from these static and serial
approaches, at the end of the day, these analyses still only provide us with “immune snapshots” of the Ag-specific
memory clones and tissue resident memory cells. This limits us from asking key questions such as which signals
facilitate or prevent the recruitment, retention, and survival of specific populations of tissue resident human
memory cells. We are also unable to precisely measure the evolution of Ag-specific clones over time or assess
whether microenvironment or immune perturbations influences the evolution and durability of these clones of
cells. This knowledge gap is the basis for the Cooperative Centers in Human Immunology (CCHI) U19 application
entitled “Evolution and Durability of Human T and B cell Responses”. The goal of this Program is to address the
knowledge gap by leveraging our access to samples from organ transplant recipients to: (i) monitor cellular
trafficking of memory cells from circulation into tissues over time; (ii) study the evolution of memory cells that
reside in the tissue or respond to tissue specific Ags; and (iii) assess the durability of these memory populations
over time and in response to changes in the environment. The central hypothesis addressed in this program is
that the human immune memory compartment is constantly evolving in response to local and systemic signals
that influence both the durability and reactivity profile of these cells. We will address this hypothesis in three
research Projects that are supported by three scientific service Cores. Project 1 will address the factors that
control the evolution and durability of memory B cells and antibody secreting cells that contribute to organ failure
and rejection in kidney transplant patients. Project 2 will study the generation and durability of memory T cells
that reside in the endometrium of uterus transplant patients. Project 3 will assess B cell and antibody responses
in lung transplants. The three science service Cores will support the overarching goals of the Program and will
provide the individual projects with the tools needed to track and analyze memory T cells, memory B cells and
antibodies. We believe that the studies in this Proposal are important because they are designed to address
fundamental questions about the generation, evolution and durability of human memory B and T cells. In the
future, these data may be used to develop immune-modulating modalities that can be used to appropriately tune
protective and damaging memory cell-driven immune responses.",Evolution and Durability of Human T and B Cell Responses,"Narrative
If we want to understand how cells of the immune system, like B cells and T cells, can both protect from
infections and cause damage in settings like organ transplant or autoimmunity, it is important to be able to
follow the protective and damaging cells over time to see where they go, what they do and how long they live.
The goal of this Program is to analyze the different types of B and T cells in samples of blood and biopsies
from transplanted tissues that are collected multiple times over months to years from the same transplant
patients. In the future, this information could be used to develop better treatments to eliminate the immune
cells that cause damage in the organ without affecting the cells that protect us from infections.",https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10824851,Address;Affect;Antibodies;Antibody Response;Antigen Receptors;Antigens;Autoimmunity;B-Cell Antigen Receptor;B-Lymphocytes;Bioinformatics;Biophysics;Biopsy;Blood;Blood specimen;Cell Lineage;Cell secretion;Cells;Chronic;Circulation;Clone Cells;Cloning;Complex;Cytoprotection;Data;Development;Endometrial;Endometrium;Environment;Evolution;Future;Generations;Goals;Homeostasis;Human;Immune;Immune response;Immune system;Immunoglobulin-Secreting Cells;Immunologic Memory;Immunology;Individual;Infection;Inflammatory;Informatics;Kidney Transplantation;Knowledge;Learning;Location;Lung;Lung Transplantation;Lymphocyte;Lymphoid;Measures;Memory;Memory B-Lymphocyte;Modality;Monitor;Mucous Membrane;Mus;Natural regeneration;Organ;Organ Transplantation;Organ failure;Phenotype;Population;Production;Property;Reagent;Research Project Grants;Residencies;Respiratory System;Sampling;Science;Services;Signal Transduction;Sorting;T memory cell;T-Lymphocyte;Time;Tissue Transplantation;Tissues;Transplant Recipients;Uterus;Vaccination;Validation;Viral Proteins;Virus;Visualization;antigen binding;biophysical analysis;cell injury;data analysis pipeline;data integration;design;donor-specific antibody;immune clearance;immunoregulation;multidimensional data;organ transplant recipient;organ transplant rejection;pathogen;prevent;programs;recruit;response;tissue resident memory T cell;tool;trafficking,10824851,1U19AI181105-01,,,,,,,,"['address', 'affect', 'antibodies', 'antibody response', 'antigen receptors', 'antigens', 'autoimmunity', 'b-cell antigen receptor', 'b-lymphocytes', 'bioinformatics', 'biophysics', 'biopsy', 'blood', 'blood specimen', 'cell lineage', 'cell secretion', 'cells', 'chronic', 'circulation', 'clone cells', 'cloning', 'complex', 'cytoprotection', 'data', 'development', 'endometrial', 'endometrium', 'environment', 'evolution', 'future', 'generations', 'goals', 'homeostasis', 'human', 'immune', 'immune response', 'immune system', 'immunoglobulin-secreting cells', 'immunologic memory', 'immunology', 'individual', 'infection', 'inflammatory', 'informatics', 'kidney transplantation', 'knowledge', 'learning', 'location', 'lung', 'lung transplantation', 'lymphocyte', 'lymphoid', 'measures', 'memory', 'memory b-lymphocyte', 'modality', 'monitor', 'mucous membrane', 'mus', 'natural regeneration', 'organ', 'organ transplantation', 'organ failure', 'phenotype', 'population', 'production', 'property', 'reagent', 'research project grants', 'residencies', 'respiratory system', 'sampling', 'science', 'services', 'signal transduction', 'sorting', 't memory cell', 't-lymphocyte', 'time', 'tissue transplantation', 'tissues', 'transplant recipients', 'uterus', 'vaccination', 'validation', 'viral proteins', 'virus', 'visualization', 'antigen binding', 'biophysical analysis', 'cell injury', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data integration', 'design', 'donor-specific antibody', 'immune clearance', 'immunoregulation', 'multidimensional data', 'organ transplant recipient', 'organ transplant rejection', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'tissue resident memory t cell', 'tool', 'trafficking']",,
"Project Summary
The B cell compartment is comprised of many individual cells, each of which may express a distinct B cell
receptor (BCR). Upon antigen engagement, B cells proliferate resulting in clonal expansion, and may further
diversify their BCR genes through somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination. These two
processes allow for affinity maturation toward the insulting antigen and the distribution of Ab reactivity across
isotypes which interface with other components of the immune system defining an Abs effector function. Clonal
expansion and diversification result in the presence of expanded groups of B cells with similar BCRs (clonal
lineages). The overarching goal of this program is to investigate the evolution and durability of immune responses
to allo, self, and foreign antigens. Although sequencing of BCR genes allows the visualization of cell expansions
and diversification that occur during the evolution of B cell responses, sequence information alone is insufficient
to evaluate changes in antigen binding that occur as immune responses evolve. The Antigen Receptor
Sequencing, Cloning, Expression, and Analysis Core (Core B) will facilitate the objectives of this program
by allowing the analysis of these two distinct but related features of humeral immunity. We will support the aims
of the projects through the following activities: i) Generating antigen receptor sequence information. Projects
require repertoire level sequence information form bulk and sorted lymphocytes, BCR for Projects 1 and 3, TCR
for Project 2. Core B will centralize the processing and quality control involved in generating next-generation of
antigen receptor libraries. We will coordinate with the Projects and with Core D, the Data and Informatics Service
Core, for analysis. ii) Generating Abs by cloning and expressing the BCR of single-sorted antigen-reactive B
cells as recombinant Ab. Both Projects 1 and 3 of this proposal are evaluating the reactivity of antigen-reactive
B cells to a variety of specificities, allo- and auto-HLA, and viral pathogen derived antigens. Using a high-
throughput Ab cloning and expression system, Core B will produce recombinant Abs from the cloned BCR of
single-sorted antigen reactive B cells across reactive with these antigens. iii) Evaluating the specificity, relative
affinity, and cross reactivity of Abs. Because understanding the effects of SHM, the relation of antigen reactivity
within and across expanded lineages, the relative affinity of Abs to their antigens and related structures requires
physical measurements of binding, Core B will evaluate Abs reactivity profiles using multiplexed cytometric
arrays. iv) Core B will generate Ab and Fab expression vectors to support the bio-physical measurements of Ab
binding and structural studies performed by Core C. Collectively, these activities will promote synergy between
the Projects and the Cores of this proposal and accelerate the research by providing access to specialized
techniques and reagents while centralizing approaches requiring technical expertise and instrumentation.","Core B: Antigen Receptor Sequencing, Cloning, Expression, and Analysis Core",,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10824853,Acceleration;Affinity;Alleles;Alloantigen;Antibodies;Antibody Affinity;Antibody Formation;Antigen Receptors;Antigens;Autoantigens;B Cell Proliferation;B-Cell Antigen Receptor;B-Cell Receptor Binding;B-Lymphocytes;B-cell receptor repertoire sequencing;Binding;Cell Compartmentation;Cells;Cessation of life;Clonal Expansion;Cloning;Custom;Data;Data Analyses;Development;Endowment;Enzymes;Evolution;Flow Cytometry;Frequencies;Generations;Goals;HLA Antigens;Human;Immune response;Immune system;Immunity;Immunoglobulin Class Switching;Immunoglobulin Isotypes;Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation;Immunoglobulin Switch Recombination;Individual;Informatics;Libraries;Ligation;Lymphocyte;Measurement;Monitor;Mutation;Organ Transplantation;Population;Process;Production;Proliferating;Property;Quality Control;Reaction;Reagent;Receptor Gene;Recombinant Antibody;Research;Research Project Grants;Resources;Sampling;Serum;Services;Sorting;Specificity;Standardization;Structure;System;T-Lymphocyte;Technical Expertise;Techniques;Tissue Donors;Tissues;Transplant Recipients;Transplantation and Immune System;Validation;Viral;Visualization;antibody-mediated rejection;antigen binding;assay development;biophysical analysis;biophysical properties;cross reactivity;design;donor-specific antibody;expression vector;graft failure;graft function;indexing;instrumentation;next generation;next generation sequencing;pathogenic virus;programs;recruit;response;synergism,10824853,1U19AI181105-01,,,,,,,,"['acceleration', 'affinity', 'alleles', 'alloantigen', 'antibodies', 'antibody affinity', 'antibody formation', 'antigen receptors', 'antigens', 'autoantigens', 'b cell proliferation', 'b-cell antigen receptor', 'b-cell receptor binding', 'b-lymphocytes', 'b-cell receptor repertoire sequencing', 'binding', 'cell compartmentation', 'cells', 'cessation of life', 'clonal expansion', 'cloning', 'custom', 'data', 'data analyses', 'development', 'endowment', 'enzymes', 'evolution', 'flow cytometry', 'frequencies', 'generations', 'goals', 'hla antigens', 'human', 'immune response', 'immune system', 'immunity', 'immunoglobulin class switching', 'immunoglobulin isotypes', 'immunoglobulin somatic hypermutation', 'immunoglobulin switch recombination', 'individual', 'informatics', 'libraries', 'ligation', 'lymphocyte', 'measurement', 'monitor', 'mutation', 'organ transplantation', 'population', 'process', 'production', 'proliferating', 'property', 'quality control', 'reaction', 'reagent', 'receptor gene', 'recombinant antibody', 'research', 'research project grants', 'resources', 'sampling', 'serum', 'services', 'sorting', 'specificity', 'standardization', 'structure', 'system', 't-lymphocyte', 'technical expertise', 'techniques', 'tissue donors', 'tissues', 'transplant recipients', 'transplantation and immune system', 'validation', 'viral', 'visualization', 'antibody-mediated rejection', 'antigen binding', 'assay development', 'biophysical analysis', 'biophysical properties', 'cross reactivity', 'design', 'donor-specific antibody', 'expression vector', 'graft failure', 'graft function', 'indexing', 'instrumentation', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'pathogenic virus', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'synergism']",,
"PROJECT SUMMARY
Patients receiving organ transplants have the risk of organ rejection due to mismatched human leukocyte
antigens (HLA). Though organ recipients are screened for pre-formed anti-HLA antibodies (HLA-Abs) and are
cross-matched using donor cells and recipient serum prior to transplantation, up to 25% of kidney transplant
recipients will develop a new donor-specific HLA-Ab following transplant. Within that patient group, there is a 40%
decline in 10-year graft survival. At the heart of this negative outcome are antibody-secreting cells (ASCs), which
produce donor-specific Abs, and memory B cells (Bmems), which may provide help to alloreactive T cells and
differentiate into ASCs. Current immunosuppressive therapies aimed at depleting ASCs and Bmems are largely
ineffective. Thus, Ab-mediated rejection remains a significant clinical problem. The overall objective of this U19
Program is to define the factors that govern the evolution of memory lymphocyte responses over time and to
assess the durability of these responses. Two Projects in this U19 will specifically focus on characterizing the
evolution and durability of the Bmem and ASC subsets responsible for alloimmune responses elicited toward
donor-specific HLA Class-I and Class-II alleles. To perform these studies, Projects will require antigen-specific
reagents to aide in identification of antigen-specific B cells, clone B cell receptors, and further characterize
antigen to Ab interactions. One objective of the Immuno-Reagent Production, Validation, and Biophysical
Analysis Core (Core C) is to provide these reagents, which will include B cell tetramers (specific to HLA alleles
and respiratory viral antigens), Abs, Fabs, antigen-specific polyclonal antibodies (pAbs), and proteins for
structural studies. By centralizing the production and validation of proteins for distribution within the Program,
the expertise of Core C will allow Projects to focus on their own Aims, unimpeded by the time and effort to
develop these reagents on their own. A second objective of Core C is to function as a multidisciplinary biophysical
analysis center. In this capacity, we will coordinate with Projects to analyze antibody to antigen interactions.
Using surface plasmon resonance, we will develop an understanding of these interactions at the kinetic level.
Using X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, we will observe epitope-paratope interfaces at near
atomic resolution. Lastly, we will perform proteomics experiments using mass spectrometry with pAbs to aide in
assigning pools of Abs to lineages. In summary, Core C will provide reagents to the exceptional group of
Immunologists in the Program to expedite their discoveries. Biophysical analyses will provide new innovation
and synergy to these groups. Structural biology will be a transformative tool for the Projects that will lead to

"IOFM Core: Infrastructure and Opportunity Fund Management Core
Project Summary
The NIH Cooperative Centers on Human Immunology (CCHI) are designed to promote human immunology
research focused on understanding the mechanisms underlying human immune system regulation and function;
the ultimate goal being the prevention and treatment of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The Program
provides funding for 5-7 Centers as well as additional financial support for collaborative and pilot/feasibility
projects, resource and reagent development, translational projects, and/or early-stage investigator projects
provided through the Infrastructure and Opportunity Fund (IOF). One of the Centers funded through the CCHI
U19 mechanism is selected to establish an Infrastructure and Opportunity Fund Management Core (IOFMC),
which bears the responsibility of managing and distributing the IOF. Working with the NIH Program Officer and
the CCHI Steering Committee, the major goal of the UAB IOFMC will be to establish an administrative structure
that will manage the supplemental projects from the solicitation of applications, through pre- and post-award, to
award close-out and reporting The UAB IOFMC will: i) coordinate the IOF project solicitation, application and
selection process; ii) establish subcontracts to distribute IOF supplemental awards to recipients at other
institutions, usually another CCHI Center, but often a collaborating institution; iii) provide administrative, reporting
and fiscal oversight of the IOF awards to ensure that the recipient of the award and the institution in which they
work are in compliance with all applicable NIH and federal regulations and that charges to the subaward are
reasonable, allocable and allowable; iv) support the NIH Program Officer and CCHI Steering Committee in the
execution and advancement of programmatic decisions; and v) serve as the liaison between the IOF awardees,
CCHI Steering Committee and the NIH. The IOFMC will also develop and manage a website for CCHI activities.
Completion of these objectives by the UAB IOFMC will allow the NIH to successfully leverage the existing and

overall scientific goals of the CCHI.",Infrastructure and Opportunity Fund Management Core (IOFMC),,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10824856,Agreement;Award;B-Lymphocytes;Budgets;Charge;Collaborations;Contracts;Development;Direct Costs;Disease;Ensure;Ethics;Evolution;Facilities and Administrative Costs;Financial Support;Funding;Funding Opportunities;Future;Goals;Grant;Human;Immune;Immune system;Immunology;Infrastructure;Institution;Language;Laws;Mediating;Mission;Notification;Policies;Prevention;Process;Reagent;Regulation;Reporting;Request for Applications;Research;Research Personnel;Resources;Sampling;Scientist;Structure;T-Lymphocyte;United States National Institutes of Health;Work;design;member;payment;programs;response;web site,10824856,1U19AI181105-01,,,,,,,,"['agreement', 'award', 'b-lymphocytes', 'budgets', 'charge', 'collaborations', 'contracts', 'development', 'direct costs', 'disease', 'ensure', 'ethics', 'evolution', 'facilities and administrative costs', 'financial support', 'funding', 'funding opportunities', 'future', 'goals', 'grant', 'human', 'immune', 'immune system', 'immunology', 'infrastructure', 'institution', 'language', 'laws', 'mediating', 'mission', 'notification', 'policies', 'prevention', 'process', 'reagent', 'regulation', 'reporting', 'request for applications', 'research', 'research personnel', 'resources', 'sampling', 'scientist', 'structure', 't-lymphocyte', 'united states national institutes of health', 'work', 'design', 'member', 'payment', 'programs', 'response', 'web site']",,
"PROJECT SUMMARY
This application proposes a customized research training plan designed to promote the development of the
applicant into an independent investigator. The plan includes advanced training in laboratory experimentation,
along with tailored professional and career development opportunities. The training plan is supported by the
outstanding availability of local and institutional resources at UIC. The proposed research will investigate the
role of extracellular vesicles in mediating endothelial cell-fibroblast communication in the healing wound. In
human skin, the process of wound repair involves angiogenesis, which includes the creation and then pruning
of vessels. Simultaneously, fibroblasts in the wound are responsible for the deposition of the extracellular
matrix components that surround the new vasculature. The goal of the proposed studies is to examine how
endothelial cells communicate with surrounding fibroblasts in the wound. Several previous studies demonstrate
that these two cell types may utilize paracrine methods of communication to influence or enhance their
functional roles, but how this intercellular interaction occurs is largely unknown. One potential mechanism by
which endothelial cells might communicate with fibroblasts is through extracellular vesicles and their microRNA
cargo. Recent studies in our lab have shown that fibroblasts treated with extracellular vesicles from endothelial
cells exhibit significant transcriptomic changes. Based on this preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that in
the healing wound, endothelial cells secrete extracellular vesicles that influence the function of resident
fibroblasts. The research plan utilizes methods for extracellular vesicle purification and application, traditional
in vitro and in vivo wound healing assays, and advanced bioinformatics techniques to study extracellular
vesicle-mediated communication between these two cells types. Aim 1 will determine how fibroblast
phenotypes are altered by endothelial cell extracellular vesicle treatment, and will examine the role of cargo
microRNAs in the observed changes. In vitro studies will elucidate the effect of endothelial cell extracellular
vesicle treatment on the fibroblast transcriptome and key fibroblast functions, such as collagen contraction,
deposition, and proliferation. Aim 2 will evaluate how endothelial cell extracellular vesicles affect fibroblast
phenotypes in the wound in vivo using a splinted murine skin wound model. The effect of extracellular vesicle
treatment will be examined for multiple parameters of healing, including collagen content and architecture,
myofibroblast activation, angiogenesis, and wound closure. Finally, single cell-RNA sequencing of wound
fibroblasts will be used to determine how endothelial cell extracellular vesicle uptake modifies the fibroblast
transcriptional profile. Together, the aims will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms by which
endothelial cells might modulate fibroblast function, and may lead to the development of novel therapies to
treat wounds or various skin and fibrotic diseases.",Endothelial cell-fibroblast communication in skin wound healing,"PROJECT NARRATIVE
Within healing wounds, many different types of cells work together to repair damaged tissue. This proposal will
examine how small extracellular vesicles released by one cell type, endothelial cells, affect the function and
behavior of another cell type, fibroblasts, in the context of the healing wound. The results of this study will
better inform our fundamental understanding of how cells communicate in wounds, and may lead us to
discover new therapies to improve healing or prevent scar formation.",https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10825394,Adipose tissue;Affect;Architecture;Behavior;Binding;Bioinformatics;Biological Assay;Cell Communication;Cell Physiology;Cell secretion;Cells;Cicatrix;Collagen;Communication;Communication Methods;Complex;DNA;Data;Deposition;Dermal;Dermis;Development;Disease;Endocrine;Endothelial Cells;Environment;Epidermis;Epithelium;Excision;Exhibits;Exposure to;Extracellular Matrix;Fibroblasts;Gene Expression Profile;Gene Targeting;Goals;Granulation Tissue;Hemostatic function;Human;In Vitro;Infiltration;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Institution;Label;Lipids;Mediating;Mediator;Membrane;Methods;MicroRNAs;Molecular;Mus;Myofibroblast;Nucleic Acids;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Phase;Phenotype;Physiological;Population;Process;Proliferating;Proteins;Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR;Research;Research Personnel;Research Training;Resources;Role;Scleroderma;Signal Transduction;Skin;Skin injury;Skin wound healing;Small RNA;Sorting;Specific qualifier value;Splint Device;Systemic Scleroderma;Techniques;Testing;Thick;Tissues;Training;Transfection;Untranslated RNA;Vascularization;Work;Wound models;angiogenesis;autocrine;career development;cell type;comparison control;design;experimental study;extracellular vesicles;healing;improved;in silico;in vitro Assay;in vivo;intercellular communication;laboratory experiment;novel;novel therapeutics;paracrine;particle;prevent;repaired;single-cell RNA sequencing;skin wound;standard measure;subcutaneous;therapeutic target;transcriptome;transcriptome sequencing;transcriptomics;uptake;vesicular release;wound;wound closure;wound healing;wound treatment,10825394,1F31AR083830-01,,,,,,,,"['adipose tissue', 'affect', 'architecture', 'behavior', 'binding', 'bioinformatics', 'biological assay', 'cell communication', 'cell physiology', 'cell secretion', 'cells', 'cicatrix', 'collagen', 'communication', 'communication methods', 'complex', 'dna', 'data', 'deposition', 'dermal', 'dermis', 'development', 'disease', 'endocrine', 'endothelial cells', 'environment', 'epidermis', 'epithelium', 'excision', 'exhibits', 'exposure to', 'extracellular matrix', 'fibroblasts', 'gene expression profile', 'gene targeting', 'goals', 'granulation tissue', 'hemostatic function', 'human', 'in vitro', 'infiltration', 'inflammation', 'inflammatory', 'institution', 'label', 'lipids', 'mediating', 'mediator', 'membrane', 'methods', 'micrornas', 'molecular', 'mus', 'myofibroblast', 'nucleic acids', 'pathology', 'pathway interactions', 'phase', 'phenotype', 'physiological', 'population', 'process', 'proliferating', 'proteins', 'quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr', 'research', 'research personnel', 'research training', 'resources', 'role', 'scleroderma', 'signal transduction', 'skin', 'skin injury', 'skin wound healing', 'small rna', 'sorting', 'specific qualifier value', 'splint device', 'systemic scleroderma', 'techniques', 'testing', 'thick', 'tissues', 'training', 'transfection', 'untranslated rna', 'vascularization', 'work', 'wound models', 'angiogenesis', 'autocrine', 'career development', 'cell type', 'comparison control', 'design', 'experimental study', 'extracellular vesicles', 'healing', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vitro assay', 'in vivo', 'intercellular communication', 'laboratory experiment', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'paracrine', 'particle', 'prevent', 'repaired', 'single-cell rna sequencing', 'skin wound', 'standard measure', 'subcutaneous', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'uptake', 'vesicular release', 'wound', 'wound closure', 'wound healing', 'wound treatment']",,
"Project Summary
There has been an increase in the number of thyroid cancer survivors due to the rise in thyroid cancer
incidence and young age at diagnosis. Although a substantial proportion of these survivors were likely cured
with initial treatment, due to limited data and subsequent inability of physicians to confidently risk-stratify,
surveillance for recurrence continues for many years, often lifelong. Unnecessary surveillance results in
cancer-related worry, additional testing leading to false positive test results, and in some instances,
complications from additional treatments. Through our collaboration with SEER sites Georgia (includes Atlanta,
Greater Georgia, Rural Georgia) and Los Angeles County, we will have access to diverse, population-based
cohorts of patients, in whom we can determine recurrence risk as well as current and optimal long-term
surveillance. Our multipronged data collection strategy will allow us to obtain recurrence details from pathology
reports, augmented with mortality data, patient report, and physician chart review and reporting. External
validation will occur with use of the comprehensive University of Michigan Precision Health data. We will
determine characteristics of cohorts at lower and higher risk of cancer recurrence, use these data to inform
more tailored surveillance care pathways, and then refine surveillance care pathways after assessing trade-
offs and net benefit. The ability to categorize thyroid cancer survivors into meaningful recurrence risk-stratified
groups, tailor surveillance care pathways to recurrence risk, and then refine surveillance care pathways after
assessing trade-offs will inform appropriate long-term follow-up, reduce patient harm, and improve healthcare
costs. This study will dramatically change the care of thyroid cancer patients and will serve as a model for risk-
stratified surveillance for other cancer types.",Risk-stratified care for thyroid cancer survivors,"Project Narrative

"ABSTRACT
Approximately 2.8 million people sustain a traumatic brain injury (TBI) yearly in the United States, with over
500,000 emergency room visits being attributed to childhood-acquired brain trauma (<14 years of age).
Survivors often endure long-term cognitive and emotional disabilities that reduce quality of life and the ability to
return to school/workforce. Current and past research has largely overlooked complex attention impairments
post-TBI, especially in conjunction with overlapping clinical comorbidities, which may exacerbate injury effects.
We aim to remedy the paucity of studies examining comorbidities of TBI by exploring how hypertension/high
blood pressure, a common underlying condition, can affect TBI-related neurological, physiological, and
cognitive impairments. An estimated 50% of the adult population is diagnosed with hypertension, which can
lead to heart attacks, blocked or damaged arteries, reduced blood flow to the muscles, strokes, and premature
death. Thus, there is a critical need to investigate preclinical models of TBI that are also affected by
hypertension (i.e., hypertensive rats) to better characterize neurological, physiological, and cognitive
impairments, in an effort to enhance bench-to-bedside translatability by more closely reflecting the existing
clinical landscape. This study explores the effects of TBI on Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHR), a widely
used animal model of hypertension, by administering a battery of behavioral assays across different modalities,
such as motor coordination/balance, higher-order sustained and flexible attention, and anxiety-like symptoms.
Moreover, it is important to determine whether being subjected to TBI during pediatric (i.e., prior to
developing stable hypertension at 16 weeks of age) or adult age (i.e., after hypertension onset) alters
physiological, emotional, and cognitive outcomes long term. The aims are designed to 1) determine
interactions of moderate parietal TBI and age-at-impact (pediatric versus adulthood) on motor function (rotarod
test), sustained attention and impulsivity (3-choice serial reaction time task), cognitive flexibility (attentional set-
shifting test), and anxiety-like responses (elevated plus-maze test, shock-probe defensive burying) in SHR
versus normotensive male and female adult rats, and 2) evaluate TBI-induced and sex-related differences in
histological assessments of lesion volumes, neuronal survival, and neuroinflammation markers in SHR versus
normotensive rats. Studies will be conducted in both male and normal cycling female rats, an approach that is
clinically relevant. Women represent up to 45% of the TBI cases, thus evaluating normal cycling female rats
parallels the real world, where injuries occur independent of menstrual cycles. The findings from this R21
Exploratory/Developmental Research Grant will serve as proof-of-concept for significant future funding support
from the National Institutes of Health, the American Heart Association, or the US Department of Veterans
Affairs, as dissecting the impact that underlying conditions such as hypertension may have on TBI preclinically
is critical to further developing clinically-relevant therapies.",Neurobehavioral and pathophysiological effects of traumatic brain injury in spontaneously hypertensive rats,"Project Narrative
Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are heterogeneous and affect approximately 69 million persons annually
worldwide, causing debilitating and enduring complex cognitive and psychosocial impairments regardless of
injury location, yet the preclinical research to date has largely overlooked attention and emotional deficits post-
TBI, which may be exacerbated by the presence of clinical comorbidities. The overarching aim of this R21
proposal is to remedy the paucity of studies examining comorbidities during the TBI recovery phase, by
exploring how adult-onset hypertension (i.e., high blood pressure), a common underlying condition for
approximately 50% of the adult United States population, may impact long-term motor, complex cognitive, and
anxiety-like alterations subsequent to pediatric or adult injuries. The findings from the proposed preclinical
studies, carried out in both male and female rats, will advance our understanding of neurobehavioral and
histopathological alterations in survivors of brain trauma living with comorbid hypertension, as well as facilitate
identifying mechanisms through which therapeutic and rehabilitative approaches may be targeted to relevant
symptoms in the clinic.",https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10879381,14 year old;Adult;Affect;Age;American Heart Association;Animal Model;Anxiety;Area;Arteries;Astrocytes;Attention;Behavior assessment;Behavioral Assay;Blood flow;Brain region;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cessation of life;Childhood;Childhood Injury;Chronic;Clinic;Clinical;Cognitive;Complex;Contralateral;Corpus striatum structure;Development;Diagnosis;Emergency department visit;Emotional;Equilibrium;Exhibits;Female;Funding;Future;Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein;Heart Rate;Hippocampus;Histologic;Human;Hypertension;Immunohistochemistry;Impaired cognition;Impairment;Impulsivity;Inbred SHR Rats;Inbred WKY Rats;Injury;Ipsilateral;Knowledge;Learning;Lesion;Location;Medical;Menstrual cycle;Modality;Motor;Muscle;Myocardial Infarction;Neurocognitive;Neurologic;Outcome;Parietal;Patients;Persons;Phase;Phenotype;Physiological;Population;Pre-Clinical Model;Quality of life;Rattus;Reaction Time;Rehabilitation therapy;Research;Research Project Grants;Rotarod Performance Test;Schools;Severities;Sex Differences;Shock;Stroke;Survivors;Symptoms;Testing;Thalamic structure;Therapeutic;Time;Tissues;Traumatic Brain Injury;Traumatic Brain Injury recovery;United States;United States Department of Veterans Affairs;United States National Institutes of Health;Walking;Woman;bench to bedside;clinically relevant;comorbidity;controlled cortical impact;decubitus ulcer;design;disability;experimental study;flexibility;hypertensive;injured;male;neurobehavioral;neuroinflammation;neuronal survival;normotensive;novel;pre-clinical;pre-clinical research;preclinical study;premature;psychosocial;response;sustained attention;young adult,10879381,1R21NS137253-01,,,,,,,,"['14 year old', 'adult', 'affect', 'age', 'american heart association', 'animal model', 'anxiety', 'area', 'arteries', 'astrocytes', 'attention', 'behavior assessment', 'behavioral assay', 'blood flow', 'brain region', 'cardiovascular diseases', 'cessation of life', 'childhood', 'childhood injury', 'chronic', 'clinic', 'clinical', 'cognitive', 'complex', 'contralateral', 'corpus striatum structure', 'development', 'diagnosis', 'emergency department visit', 'emotional', 'equilibrium', 'exhibits', 'female', 'funding', 'future', 'glial fibrillary acidic protein', 'heart rate', 'hippocampus', 'histologic', 'human', 'hypertension', 'immunohistochemistry', 'impaired cognition', 'impairment', 'impulsivity', 'inbred shr rats', 'inbred wky rats', 'injury', 'ipsilateral', 'knowledge', 'learning', 'lesion', 'location', 'medical', 'menstrual cycle', 'modality', 'motor', 'muscle', 'myocardial infarction', 'neurocognitive', 'neurologic', 'outcome', 'parietal', 'patients', 'persons', 'phase', 'phenotype', 'physiological', 'population', 'pre-clinical model', 'quality of life', 'rattus', 'reaction time', 'rehabilitation therapy', 'research', 'research project grants', 'rotarod performance test', 'schools', 'severities', 'sex differences', 'shock', 'stroke', 'survivors', 'symptoms', 'testing', 'thalamic structure', 'therapeutic', 'time', 'tissues', 'traumatic brain injury', 'traumatic brain injury recovery', 'united states', 'united states department of veterans affairs', 'united states national institutes of health', 'walking', 'woman', 'bench to bedside', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'controlled cortical impact', 'decubitus ulcer', 'design', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'hypertensive', 'injured', 'male', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuronal survival', 'normotensive', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'preclinical study', 'premature', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'sustained attention', 'young adult']",,
"Project Summary
Recently, we identified the cerebellum as a novel satiation center in the brain. Yet, little is known about the
pathways and circuit mechanisms through which the cerebellum regulates food intake. The major research goal
of this proposal is to define cerebellar à striatal circuits that regulate food intake and better understand the
physiological changes mediated by activity in this circuit. We have recently identified a subset of molecularly and
topographically-distinct neurons in the lateral nucleus of the mouse anterior deep cerebellar nuclei (aDCN-lat)
that are activated by food intake (Low et al., 2021). Our functional assessment of these neurons demonstrates
that activation of aDCN-lat neurons dramatically decreases food intake by reducing meal size without
compensatory changes to metabolic rate. We discovered that activity in aDCN-lat neurons reduces the phasic
dopamine response to additional food, likely curbing the urge to eat by reducing the reward value of additional
food (Low et al., 2021). Based on published and preliminary data, the central hypotheses of this proposal are
that: 1) food- and nutrient-sensing aDCN-lat neurons are polysynaptically linked to the striatum through
subcortical pathways to influence striatal dopamine levels, and these neurons have a unique molecular profile
that changes during obesity; 2) aDCN-lat mediated dopamine changes influence neural activity in a subset of
striatal neurons and regulate affective and motivational desire for food; and, 3) aDCN-striatal circuits and DA
signaling are disrupted in obesity. This proposal will test these hypotheses through three aims. Aim 1 delineates
the pathways through which aDCN-lat neurons can act on striatal dopamine and defines transcript changes in
aDCN-lat neurons of diet-induced obese mice. We will use viral tools (AAVretro and rabies) to determine the
intermediate targets of aDCN-lat neurons (hypothesized to be linked by ventral tegmental area and substantia
nigra) and single nuclei RNA-sequencing to identify changes in transcripts of aDCN-lat neurons in obese mice.
In Aim 2, we will examine the influence of aDCN-mediated changes in striatal DA levels on the neural activity of
specific striatal neuron subtypes (D1R and D2R). These experiments will allow us to examine how cerebellar
activity influences the striatal response to food anticipation, consumption and gastric nutrients. Finally, the
experiments in Aim 3 will assess how diet-induced obesity impacts aDCN-mediated changes in striatal neural
activity at a single cell level, and more importantly test the hypothesis that silencing the DCN leads to an ‘obesity-
like’ pattern of neural activity in the striatum. By defining cerebellar-striatal pathways, how cerebellar activity
controls striatal neuron function, and how this circuitry might be disrupted in obesity, this work will reveal circuit
mechanisms that regulate food reward processing with added translational value of guiding the development of
non-invasive cerebellar stimulation and cell-type specific pharmacological manipulation of striatal neurons for
long-term body weight management.",Cerebellar-striatal circuits for control of dopamine activity and food intake,"Project Narrative

"PROJECT SUMMARY
Since 1958, public schools in the United States have used school resource officers (SROs) as a community-
based policing strategy to prevent school violence. However, recent evidence questions the effectiveness of
SRO programs and highlights their link to increased student discipline and arrests, particularly for marginalized
groups. Approximately 28 states have passed policy reforms to mitigate the potentially adverse effects of SRO
programs on student outcomes. Yet, no study has examined whether and how state SRO laws impact student
outcomes, SRO practices, and SRO policies at the local level. This proposed research project will address
these gaps by examining the impact and implementation of state SRO laws in schools with SRO programs.
Aim 1 focuses on assessing state-level variation in SRO policies, including their presence, scope, and
structure, by developing a longitudinal database on state-level SRO laws until 2024. Aim 2 investigates the
association between state SRO policies and disciplinary policies/outcomes in schools with SRO programs
using a nationally representative sample of US public schools with SRO programs. Aim 3 delves into the local-
level implementation of state SRO policies, exploring barriers and facilitators in school districts with SRO
programs. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with school administrators, staff, law enforcement, and
students to understand how SRO programs and policy reforms have been implemented among a diverse
representation of school districts across the US. Aim 4 focuses on the development and testing of a toolkit to
implement SRO policy reforms using findings from Aims 1-3. The acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility
of the toolkit will be evaluated with school districts. By examining the complex interplay between state-level
policies, district implementation, and disciplinary outcomes, this research addresses the National Institute of
Child Health and Human Development's goal of improving child and adolescent health and transition to
adulthood through the promotion of positive community-level (i.e., school-level) interventions that prevent youth
violence, injury, and mortality. To strengthen my skills and complete this project, I identified three critical
training areas: 1) Implementation science, with a focus on educational policy and programming; 2) Program
and policy evaluation, with an emphasis on policy surveillance; 3) Qualitative research methodology, with an
emphasis on community-based participatory research. My mentorship team has substantive expertise in public
health, psychiatry, medicine, criminology, and education. Moreover, their methodological skillsets will
strengthen my training goals. The Pathway to Independence award will be my launch pad to become an
independent researcher who works with local school communities to design culturally competent,
interdisciplinary, and health-oriented violence prevention strategies.",Examining the Implementation and Impact of School Resource Officer Policy Reform in the United States,"PROJECT NARRATIVE

"ABSTRACT
While relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) can effectively be managed by a pantheon of disease
modifying drugs with anti-inflammatory activities, the transition to secondary progressive MS (SPMS) is met with
refractoriness to therapeutics and a downward spiral of neurodegeneration. This dire scenario has called into
question the role of inflammation in SPMS, and cast SPMS treatment as a pressing unmet clinical need!
However, meningeal ectopic lymphoid tissues (mELTs), which appear during SPMS in pathognomonic fashion,
could drive atypical inflammatory activity and provide novel targets for therapeutic intervention. These
indeterminate structures are B cell-rich aggregates that accumulate in the subarachnoid space of the meninges,
and resemble tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs) observed elsewhere in the body during various autoimmune and
infectious conditions. In both MS patients and animal models, mELTs are conspicuously located over activated
sub-pial microglia in areas of extensive cortical demyelination and neuronal loss, raising speculation they rain
down as yet unknown incendiary factors that spark “compartmentalized inflammation” and neurodegeneration.
Their role in SPMS etiopathogenesis nevertheless remains ambiguous, as the composition,
compartmentalization, and gene expression of the varied cell types comprising mELTs have not been evaluated
in relation to disease status and locale along the CNS axis – factors that can significantly impact the meninges
and, thus, potentially mELTs. Technical hurdles had precluded examining these issues, but methodological
advances by this group now allow for interrogation of mELTs – histologically and transcriptionally – within their
native meningeal habitat. Two broad Aims are thus proposed to fill these major gaps, and test the hypothesis
The cellular composition, organization and gene expression of meningeal Ectopic Lymphoid Tissues
(mELTs) depend on CNS locale and disease status. Aim 1 will analyze animals at early and late stages of
secondary progressive disease, and characterize the cell composition of mELTs in brain and spinal cord.
Emphasis will be placed on identifying immune, stromal cell and vascular cell types found in known TLOs, and
detailing their 3D organization with respect to each other and meningeal elements. Attention to meninges will
be critical, as meningeal trabeculae might nucleate mELT assembly and/or segregate mELT cells into functional
domains. High-resolution, 3D fluorescence microscopy and immuno-scanning electron microscopy will be used
to view mELT cell organization at the light microscopic and ultrastructural levels, respectively, and imaging mass
cytometry to reveal the full repertoire of cells in context with meningeal structures. Aim 2 will dissect the
respective transcriptomes of the different mELT cell populations in brain and spinal cord in situ during early and
late disease, using laser capture microdissection coupled to RNA-seq to preserve context-dependent gene
expression patterns. This deliberative and methodical spatiotemporal analysis will yield foundational information
necessary for resolving the contribution of mELTs to SPMS and highlighting new therapeutic prospects.","Meningeal ectopic lymphoid tissues (mELTs): Composition, organization and expression revealed by imaging and in situ transcriptomics","PROJECT NARRATIVE
 Multiple sclerosis (MS) remains an insidious disease, with unpredictable outcomes. Though the typical form
of the disease, in which there are relapses and remissions, is responsive to many new medications, ultimately
nearly seventy percent of patients go onto a secondary progressive phase for which there is currently no effective
treatment. This application details experiments to understand the make-up and function of particular structures
that appear in the brain and spinal cord uniquely during this progressive phase – meningeal ectopic lymphoid

"Summary
Through this new NIH-funded biomedical center at the University of Kansas (KU), we aspire to leverage big
data to improve women’s health. A strong and diverse inaugural group of Research Project Leaders, spanning
the laboratory sciences and social/behavioral sciences would lead the research. Their goals include:
improving the detection and treatment of ovarian cancer; developing a better understanding of estrogen’s link
to neurodegeneration; providing women, who are at higher risk of Alzheimer’s Disease, with tools they can use
to improve their lifestyle and reduce disease probability; additionally, two different projects seek to improve
women’s health by studying lifestyles, overall health, and the impact of health-improving innovations (i.e
telemedicine) in a geographic and sex-differentiated context so that limited public health funds can be
leveraged for maximal public good. The Center would enable progress on these projects and others at the
interface of data science and women’s health by providing a strong administrative structure organized around
the following Specific Aims: 1) Advance five RPLs’ research programs (through mentoring, grant-writing
support, and professional development) 2) Engage additional research faculty (through three new tenure-track
hires and a unique Research-Engaged Faculty Fellows Program); 3)Bolster Big Data research with core lab
support (through two initiatives, the development of a new core lab focused on Biomedical Datasets and
Services, and a voucher program, supported by university matching funds, that leverages KU’s 17 existing
centralized research core lab facilities.) The well-planned theme, excellent inaugural project leaders, close
coordination with university administration, and experienced Center Director and Associate-Director all lend
strong credibility that the goals would be achieved. The successful completion of these aims will markedly
increase the biomedical research capabilities on our campus, establishing at our institution a unique center that
leverages data science for advancing women’s health research.",Leveraging Big Data to Improve Women's Health (BD-WH),"Project Narrative

Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome prevalent in hospitalized patients (10-15% affected), especially among critically ill patients (>50% affected). AKI patients are 6.5-fold more likely to die in the hospital and at much higher risk for developing poor long-term outcomes including incident and progressive chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and death. Early and reliable risk assessment is the key to proactive intervention and prevention. 
With the ever-growing availability of electronic health records (EHR), machine learning has made substantial progress in modeling the complex data for disease risk prediction including AKI. However, the majority of existing prediction models are built on data from a predefined patient cohort, also known as a global prediction model, optimized for the supposedly “average” patient. This one-size-fits-all prediction model may not work for all patients, and is especially inadequate for heterogeneous diseases such as AKI that have multiple etiologies, variable pathogenesis, and diverse outcomes. Combining patients with different etiologies in training a prediction model may hide subgroups that are more tightly associated with the clinical outcome of interest and may conceal unique pathophysiological processes specific to certain subgroups.
In our previous work, we found that a global model can make completely wrong AKI risk predictions for patients in high-risk and heterogeneous subgroups. Personalized modeling is a promising alternative in which a prediction model is dynamically trained for each incoming patient by using retrospective data of an individualized cohort of similar patients. Our previous work demonstrated that personalized modeling can capture patient heterogeneity with an improved AKI risk prediction for various subpopulations, but we also identified critical challenges to address to ensure model reliability and robustness.
The overall goal of this project is to develop personalized transfer learning methods to achieve equitable AKI prediction across subpopulations in the hospital setting. Specifically, we propose to develop new machine learning techniques to address two challenges in personalized transfer learning: (1) what is the best way to construct individualized patient cohort? and (2) how to avoid negative knowledge transfer during learning? Methods developed in this project are broadly applicable to other diseases and study findings can advance personalized clinical decision support for improving patient outcome.",Personalized Machine Learning for Acute Kidney Injury Prediction and Prognosis,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome prevalent in hospitalized patients and have multiple etiologies and diverse outcomes, which highlights the need for personalized intervention.

"SUMMARY
 The nervous system of social species has evolved to perceive and evaluate signals within a social
context. Social information therefore must impact how the brain processes information, yet little is
still known about how the brain integrates social information to produce actions in a social context.
This lack of knowledge exists in part because social context is difficult to quantify and because the
majority of studies are performed in species that do not have a particularly rich social structure. Here
we propose to study the brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater), a highly gregarious songbird
species whose social behavior has been well studied and where vocal and non-vocal communication
signals form a central and critical component of its social system.
 We have created a “smart aviary” equipped with cameras and microphones that is capable of
monitoring behavior in each individual during the entire breeding season. Our aim is to create a fully
automated system using computer vision and machine learning technology to evaluate moment-to-
moment behavioral interactions between all member of the group (9 females and 7 males) over the
entire breeding season. We have assembled an interdisciplinary team of engineers, neurobiologists
and computational scientists, to create a platform where we can record

from images using artificial neural networks and a 3D articulated mesh model. By collecting
output of the model over consecutive frames we will obtain a pose trajectory, which we will
and classify into discrete behaviora l types. We also aim to develop a miniature non-
wirelessly powered and transmitting recording device optimized for long duration recording
our aviary that critically does not impact bird individual or social behavior. Such a device would
 us to link neural activation patterns to discrete behavioral events (e.g. male song) within the
context in which these specific events occurred. Supplied with our rich dataset, we aim to
mathematical tools necessary to generate social network models that will allow us to

"Project Summary
Osteopenic fragility fractures are a devastating result of poor bone quality secondary to high mortality and long-
term patient disability. Currently there is limited understanding on the mechanistic level reflected in the relatively
few available treatment and diagnostic options. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is utilized in
combination with established patient standards for diagnosis and management of osteoporosis, however its use
is limited in patients. There is a clear need to improve technologies that enable bone quality measurements,
especially to avoid refracture.
In the proposed work we will develop technology that enables chronic insight into bone health for rodent animal
models to enable real-time high-fidelity readout enabling advanced insight for the study of mechanisms and to
evaluate the efficacy of new treatments. Specifically, we will build on our recently introduced device class,
osseosurface electronics, which are battery free and fully implantable bone strain monitors.
In aim 1 we will evaluate permanent interfacing and sensing capabilities of the platform that is grown to the bone
via calcium phosphate ceramic particles on month long timescales. Data captured from daily exercise on a
treadmill will enable insight in sensing fidelity and will be compared against gait parameters automatically
captured by deep neural net image analysis. In aim 2 we will develop a new sensing modality, thermal
conductivity measurements, that will be validated by the attachment of the biointerface to the bone, a mechanism
we already characterized with strain sensors. This platform will then be used to compare the sensitivity of serial
DEXA, µCT, in vivo strain and thermal conductivity measurement in detecting bone changes following
administration of an anabolic medication used to treat osteoporosis in aim 3. Ovariectomy animal models with
and without treatment will be evaluated by osseosurface electronics against DEXA and µCT.
Successful expansion of our osseosurface electronic platform will enable new real time and high-fidelity
measurement of bone health in freely moving small animal models. This capability is instrumental to explore
mechanisms of chronic and acute changes attributed to fracture or disease in models that have the full genetic
toolset and enable rapid test of hypothesis with little cost. The experiments will also inform the utility of the
devices towards the use in patients for chronic treatment of osteoporosis.",Osseosurface Electronics: Chronic Wireless Battery Interfaces for Osteoporosis Treatment and Discovery,"Project Narrative – Osseosurface Electronics – Chronic Wireless Battery Interfaces for

"PROJECT SUMMARY
This application aims to develop, implement, and evaluate an innovative research training program designed to
offer training and support to undergraduate students at Duke University and the University of North Carolina
(UNC) – Chapel Hill from diverse backgrounds to pursue careers in aging research. The long-term goal is to
enhance the diversification of the aging research workforce and promote scientific excellence. Diversity of
thoughts and approaches fosters innovation and creativity, and it is essential for scientific excellence. Yet, it is
well-established that much of the U.S. population scientific talent remains untapped, particularly among persons
from systematically disadvantaged social backgrounds. For example, while Hispanics/Latinos comprise nearly
20% and Blacks/African Americans 13% of the U.S. population, they represent less than 5% and 2% of R01-
awardees, respectively. The proposed Duke/University of North Carolina Advancing Diversity in Aging Research
(Duke/UNC ADAR) program will build on the infrastructure and expertise available at the Duke Center for the
Study of Aging and Human Development (Duke Aging Center) and UNC-Chapel Hill, to develop a collaborative,
state-of-the-art research training program at the forefront of providing training in aging research and resilience
to undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds. This will be accomplished by providing diverse students
at these institutions with 1) mentored “hands-on” paid research experiences, 2) weekly seminars aimed at
enhancing skills and knowledge in aging and resilience research, as well as fostering career development, and
3) facilitated engagement activities with peers, older adults and the scientific community, aimed at promoting
group cohesion, enhance interest in pursuing careers in aging research, and promote a sense of belonging in
science, which will be key to fostering professional resilience. Mentors will include faculty from the Duke Aging
Center and UNC-Chapel Hill with expertise in aging and resilience research. Up to six new students will be
selected every year to participate in this 2-year program. They will be paired with a primary mentor at Duke
University or UNC, and will have access to a larger, diverse network of co-mentors. Together, the student and
primary mentors will develop an Individual Development Plan. There will be rigorous evaluation of the students’
career progress and of the mentoring relationship. Other features of the program will include active involvement
of community leaders, group projects, and mentoring training. Short-term outcome measures will include number
and diversity of students, research presentations, submission of abstracts and feelings of belonging in science.
Mid-term outcomes will include admission to and completion of graduate school. Long-term outcome measures
will include pursuit of careers in research and aging, grant funding and attaining independent scientist status. By
combining the unique strengths of Duke and UNC-Chapel Hill, this program will sow the seeds for the
development of a cadre of diverse scientists with expertise in aging research and promote a strong community
of researchers who are equipped to optimize reserve and resilience among older adults.",Duke/UNC ADAR Program,"PROJECT NARRATIVE

"Project Summary/Abstract:
The number of Native Americans (NA) entering the Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)
workforce is the smallest proportion of any ethnicity. At the same time, this group faces tremendous health
disparities, with many directly linked to aging health. Education in, and awareness of, aging-related health issues
in NA communities involves three inter-related challenges: lack of a workforce culturally attuned to NA
communities, systemic lack of capacity for on-site biomedical research, and significant mistrust of western
scientific research and researchers. The proposed programs focus on developing NA health professionals and
academic researchers who possess both cultural competence and trust from their communities, elements critical
to eliminating health disparities and minority representation in STEM fields.
In addressing these challenges, we first recognize that many Native American students approach the world and
the means to investigate it from fundamentally different philosophical perspectives. In contrast to highly
reductionist Western models, traditional NA epistemological models are more holistic and narrative-based.
Importantly, these models, in which animate and inanimate entities are connected and interdependent, should
not be seen as pedagogic deficits, but rather as an innate strength that may allow these students to construct
and expand upon sophisticated mental models of current scientific knowledge. We have developed an
educational program that integrates established best pedagogical practices with aging research learning
experience. By integrating the holistic perspective of the Navajo culture with the scientific problem-based
approach of aging, we will advance and enrich both perspectives.
The training program proposed herein is designed to create a pipeline of NA/AI students to advance from their
colleges to aging programs at top tier research universities, creating a model of culturally grounded MSTEM
education while bolstering NIH workforce and cultural diversity. We will accomplish this goal through a series of
interrelated aims. Our first specific aim is to develop and institute a recruitment plan to attract NA/AI students
interested in aging sciences. Our second specific aim is to develop a research experience and scientific training
that integrates established best pedagogical practices with aging research. Specifically, we will focus on
developing the scientific literacy of the students, providing them with professional development opportunities and
a sense of belonging within the academic community. Our third specific aim is focused on providing a support
and retention system for NA/AI students to complete their undergraduate studies and move into the workforce
or enter graduate school.",Diversity in Research Education in Aging Medicine and Science,"Project Narrative (3 sentences):

"SUMMARY
This project will digitize and disseminate the only remaining non-digitized U.S. census records between 1790
and the present: the 1960 full-count Census. We will then use the resulting microdata to complete the largest
longitudinal data infrastructure in the U.S. The linked infrastructure currently includes data from the censuses of
1940 and 2000-2020 and will soon include data from the full-count censuses of 1950, 1970, 1980, and 1990,
and the 25% sample from 1960. The current project will incorporate the full-count 1960 Census. These new data
will provide a new mid-life observation for the oldest Americans, including those who lived through the
Depression and World War II, as well as the early-life experiences of their children who are now entering
retirement. When complete, the project will provide the final piece of a massive and powerful multi-purpose
resource that will enable a wide range of new discoveries and applications.
We will undertake four key tasks to accomplish this goal: (1) create a full-count microdata file of the 1960 Census,
(2) capture street address and assign detailed geography, (3) assign linkage keys to facilitate longitudinal
analysis, and (4) document and disseminate the new cross-sectional and longitudinal data.
With our addition of linked cases from 1960, population health researchers will be able to use these data to
analyze the life-course trajectories of hundreds of millions of Americans over the past century. Researchers will
be able to incorporate information on early and mid-life experiences—such as parental economic status,
childhood environmental exposures, public policy, social institutions, neighborhood characteristics, and housing
conditions—into investigations of the health, well-being, and mortality of Americans over their lives and through
generations.",New cross-sectional and longitudinal data for the study of aging:  1960 full-count U.S. Census,"NARRATIVE

"Problem: COVID-19 is the #8 and influenza and pneumonia the #9 leading causes of death among children.
Both COVID-19 and influenza vaccines are on the CDC recommended vaccine schedule for children and
adolescents and both are effective against severe disease. However, coverage rates for both vaccines remain
low or are dropping. Vaccine reminders are widely recommended with text messaging, as a single-method
reminder, having the largest benefit. However, behaviorally-informed COVID-19 vaccine text messages have
not been tested in a pediatric population. Additionally, while COVID-19 and influenza vaccination are going to
be due at the same time it is not known how COVID-19 and influenza vaccination reminders will interact.
We propose a pragmatic Hybrid Type 2 effectiveness/implementation trial with national scope vital to
understanding the effectiveness and implementation of COVID-19 and influenza text message reminders
across parents with varied backgrounds and whose children are cared for in diverse pediatric primary care
practice settings. AIM 1. To compare the effectiveness of behaviorally informed text message reminders
versus usual care on timely receipt of a needed COVID-19 or influenza vaccine dose in a diverse pediatric
primary care population. AIM 2. To compare the effectiveness of two implementation strategies on timely
receipt of each vaccination: combined COVID-19 and influenza vaccine reminders versus COVID-19 or
influenza reminders alone. AIM 3. To assess parental and child characteristics that modify text message
effectiveness. AIM 4. To identify contextual factors, facilitators and barriers to implementation and
sustainability of text messages for influenza and COVID-19 vaccination in a diverse pediatric population.
Methods: This multi-site trial will include 40,000 parents of 6 month-17-year-old children who are due for both
a COVID-19 and influenza vaccine. Practices will be recruited through the American Academy of Pediatrics
national Pediatric Research in Office Settings (PROS) network. In season 1, children will be randomized into 4
arms: combined COVID-19 and influenza vaccine text message reminders, COVID-19 reminders alone,
influenza reminders alone, and no reminders. Messages will be managed by the research team. The primary
outcome for Aim 1 will be timeliness of vaccine receipt (COVID-19 and/or influenza separately) from trial start.
Aim 2 will compare the implementation strategy of single vs combined reminders assessing whether combining
reminders for both vaccines leads to additive (or synergistic) or negative effects. Season 2 will be a replication
study. In season 3, practices will implement messages on their own. Using a mixed-methods approach, we will
use the RE-AIM framework in combination with the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research
(CFIR) to understand factors shaping implementation success. On a national scale, understanding the
effectiveness and implementation of influenza and COVID-19 vaccine text message reminders among a

"ABSTRACT
Anorexia nervosa (AN) has one of the highest mortality rates of all psychiatric conditions due to long-term
physical complications and a suicide rate over 50 times higher than the general population. The mortality rate
encompasses a combination of the medical sequelae of underweight and death by suicide – and increases by
around 5% with each decade of illness. Around one-third of people with AN develop a chronic disorder. If AN is
not treated, serious complications such as heart conditions and kidney failure can arise and eventually lead to
death. Despite the severity of AN, the neurobiological mechanisms that influence risk and treatment outcomes
in AN are poorly understood; AN is severely understudied compared to other psychiatric conditions. Little is
known about the alterations in brain circuitry and function in AN, and which brain changes predict future remission
or relapse. Findings to date often raise questions related to the acute state: What are the acute and lasting
effects of starvation? Which brain differences are related to the illness rather than undernutrition, and which are
reversible with treatment? Which clinical measures, risk factors, and brain abnormalities are most important in
understanding risk for AN and longer-term illness courses? To address these knowledge gaps, we launch the
ENIGMA Eating Disorders Initiative – a global alliance to bring together clinical and neuroimaging experts in
eating disorders worldwide to address pressing questions in AN research. This new international initiative is
a coordinated data analysis platform to determine multimodal neuroimaging signatures of AN from 31
diverse datasets worldwide. We build on our promising pilot data that shows 1) one of the largest effects on
brain structure ever observed among psychiatric conditions, and 2) some of the brain anomalies in AN are
reversible after weight restoration treatment in a subset of patients. Identifying circuits and functions that can be
restored, and in which patient subgroups, is critical. In the largest and most diverse worldwide dataset ever
analyzed (n~1,600 cases and ~1,700 HCs), we will identify multimodal brain biomarkers of AN, its driving
mechanisms, which brain abnormalities can be reversed, and in which patients. To boost statistical rigor,
reproducibility and power, our coordinated international alliance will pool diverse brain and clinical data
internationally using harmonized analytic workflows. We build on the successful launch of our ENIGMA Eating
Disorders working group, which published the most highly powered neuroimaging study of AN. Our Specific Aims
are to: (1) identify multimodal brain signatures of AN, with the power and diversity of data to understand which
brain signatures are reproducible in patients across the world; (2) disentangle undernutrition effects on the brain
from the aberrant brain circuitry that drives the condition and increases risk of relapse; and (3) longitudinally
assess relapse and recovery, to better predict remission and risk for AN. Our Precision Medicine approach
responds to NIMH’s mission to seek more reproducible, objective biomarkers of disease for individual monitoring
and management, to assist prognosis, and discover factors that influence relapse, suicidality, or recovery.",The ENIGMA - Eating Disorders Initiative: A Global Neuroimaging Study of Anorexia and Factors Affecting Clinical Outcomes,"NARRATIVE

"Abstract:
 Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by an uncontrolled host response to infection and is a leading
cause of death in intensive care units. Liver dysfunction contributes significantly to the morbidity and mortality
associated with sepsis. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) play a critical role in hepatic immune and
metabolic functions, but their specific role in bacterial infection and sepsis remains poorly understood.
 Our study focused on HSPA12B, a member of the HSP70 family, shows distinct expression in liver
sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), being prominent in periportal LSECs and reduced in midzonal LSECs.
Interestingly, mice lacking endothelial cell HSPA12B (eHSPA12B-/-) exhibit disrupted hepatic Kupffer zonation
and impaired hepatic gluconeogenesis even under normal conditions. Furthermore, we induced sepsis in these
mice and observed severe LSEC capillarization, along with increased bacterial load and lactate accumulation
compared to WT septic mice. These findings highlight the importance of eHSPA12B in maintaining LSEC
phenotype and as well as hepatic immune and metabolic function during sepsis.
 Further investigations revealed that eHSPA12B is necessary for GATA4 nuclear translocation in LSECs.
Endothelial cell-specific GATA4 deficiency resulted in an abnormal LSEC phenotype, impaired Kupffer cell
zonation, and dysfunction of hepatic gluconeogenesis. These data suggest a cooperative role of eGATA4 and
HSPA12B in maintaining the specialized phenotype and function of LSECs. Patients with NASH/cirrhosis are
more susceptible to bacterial infections and sepsis. Our study found decreased HSPA12B expression and
impaired GATA4 transcriptional activity in LSECs of NASH/cirrhosis patients, suggesting their contribution to
NASH/cirrhosis associated hepatic immune and metabolic dysfunction and increased susceptibility to bacterial
infections.
 Based on our novel findings, we hypothesize that eHSPA12B serves as a novel co-transcriptional factor of
GATA4 to maintain the unique phenotype and function of LSECs, and that functional LSECs play a crucial role
in maintaining Kupffer cell zonation, enhancing bacterial clearance, and regulating hepatic gluconeogenesis
during bacterial infections and sepsis. To critically evaluate this hypothesis, we propose the following aims.
Aim 1. Investigate how HSPA12B and GATA4 cooperatively regulate LSEC phenotype and function during
sepsis. Aim 2. Define the mechanisms by which LSECs regulate hepatic Kupffer cell zonation and bacterial
clearance during sepsis. Aim3. Investigate the mechanisms by which LSECs regulate hepatic
gluconeogenesis.
 Successful completion of these studies will provide novel insights into the novel role of LSEC in regulating
hepatic immune and metabolic function. These findings could be an important foundation for the development
of innovative therapeutic approaches to enhance hepatic hepatic immune and metabolic function, leading to
improved outcomes in patients with bacterial infections and sepsis.",Novel role of LSECs in hepatic immune and metabolic function during sepsis,"Sepsis, a life-threatening condition triggered by an uncontrolled response to infection, is a leading cause of

"Abstract – Molecular basis of complement anaphylatoxin receptor activation, regulation, selectivity and
signaling bias
The complement system is a vital part of the immune system, involved in promoting inflammation and clearance
of pathogens. Dysregulation of this system has been linked to various diseases, including autoimmune disorders,
neurodegenerative conditions, and cancer. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying complement
activation and signaling is crucial for therapeutic development. This study aims to investigate the molecular basis
of complement anaphylatoxin receptor activation, regulation, selectivity, and signaling bias. As part of our
studies, we will obtain valuable insights through structural determination and characterization of these receptors,
revealing unique binding pocket topologies and details of receptor activation, and signaling. The specific aims of
the study are: 1) elucidating the mechanisms of receptor activation and beta-arrestin recruitment, 2) identifying
molecular determinants of signaling bias and receptor selectivity, and 3) investigating immune response
regulation and antagonism of complement receptors. The research strategy involves cryo-electron microscopy,
signaling assays, and structural and biochemical techniques. The significance of this work lies in its potential to
advance our understanding of complement receptor biology, provide frameworks for drug design, and offer new
insights into immunomodulatory roles of these receptors. The findings could lead to the development of novel
compounds and contribute to the understanding of complement receptor functions in physiology and disease
contexts. This study represents one of the most comprehensive investigations of any GPCR subfamily to date
and aims to address long-standing questions regarding ligand selectivity, signaling bias, regulation, and
antagonism. The results will have implications for the development of tool compounds and therapeutic
interventions targeting complement receptors and have the potential to impact a wide range of diseases
associated with complement system dysfunction.","Molecular basis of complement anaphylatoxin receptor activation, regulation, selectivity and signaling bias","Narrative – Molecular basis of complement anaphylatoxin receptor activation, regulation, selectivity and

"Core A (Administrative Core): ABSTRACT
Core A (Administrative Core) is a large core that comprises sub-groups for administrative leadership, scientific
and educational leadership, database and bioresource organization, and public education and outreach. For an
efficient and central operation of the overall Center, we have integrated these distinct components under the
leadership of Core A PI, who also serves as the Center Director. Accordingly, this Core has four major aims as
follows: In Aim 1, we will provide centralized administrative leadership for the entire Center grant. In Aim 2, we
will provide centralized scientific and educational leadership for the entire Center grant. Scientific leadership
includes assistance and guidance to the Center members on three overarching scientific questions for the
Center (questions on animal-human translation, olfactory epithelium (OE) pathology, and study design that can
be linked to future validation of the discoveries from the present proposal). This Core will also facilitate and
moderate scientific collaboration with investigators outside the Center. In addition, we will provide a
“multidisciplinary” educational platform for young scholars in the Center, which includes the arrangement of
periodic group meetings and an annual retreat. Scientific rigor and integrity, as well as, an individual
development plan for each scholar will be emphasized. Furthermore, this Core will facilitate communications
with the institutional leadership and the advisory board members, and lead a preregistration of the proposed
study to the Center of Open Science. In Aim 3, we will organize bioresources and datasets, building a useful
database. The goal of this Aim is to store, organize, and keep track of datasets and resources collected in this
P50. Accordingly, we will provide the Center investigators with quick access to well-documented and
standardized databases. This central data management will improve the efficiency of the collaborations among
Projects and Cores and help to resolve confusion or conflicts. In addition, this also facilitates future data
sharing with peers and the public. Finally, in Aim 4, we will lead public education and outreach for our peers
and the general public. The overall Center will emphasize the significance of public education and outreach to
our peers and society. Accordingly, this Core will generate and maintain the web page of the P50 Conte
center, organize education and outreach plans, including the maintenance and expansion of the programs that
we have established during the past P50, such as the Schizophrenia Center Annual Symposium, Monthly
Seminar Series, Mind the Gap Workshop, and family meetings where the Center-associated physicians meet
with patients and their family members in a panel format. We believe that this Core will play a key role by
providing a central service in administrative leadership, scientific and educational leadership, database and
bioresource organization, and public education and outreach. This Core will lead research rigor and integrity. In
sum, this Core will aim to organize the Center and provide meaningful deliverables to our peers and society.",Core A,,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10862175,"Administrator;Animal Behavior;Animals;Attention;Awareness;Behavior assessment;Brain;Brain Diseases;Charge;Clinical assessments;Collaborations;Communication;Confusion;Country;Data Set;Databases;Decision Making;Development Plans;Education;Education and Outreach;Educational workshop;Family;Family member;Future;General Population;Goals;Grant;Group Meetings;Human;Individual;Institution;Internet;Lead;Leadership;Link;Maintenance;Medical;Mind;Mus;Olfactory Epithelium;Olfactory Pathways;Pathology;Patients;Pennsylvania;Periodicals;Physicians;Play;Protocols documentation;Recording of previous events;Research;Research Design;Research Personnel;Schizophrenia;Science;Series;Services;Site;Societies;Standardization;Students;Subgroup;Translations;Universities;Update;Validation;data management;data resource;data sharing;equity, diversity, and inclusion;human subject;improved;innovation;meetings;member;multidisciplinary;open data;operation;peer;programs;public education;recruit;scientific organization;symposium;web page",10862175,1P50MH136297-01,,,,,,,,"['administrator', 'animal behavior', 'animals', 'attention', 'awareness', 'behavior assessment', 'brain', 'brain diseases', 'charge', 'clinical assessments', 'collaborations', 'communication', 'confusion', 'country', 'data set', 'databases', 'decision making', 'development plans', 'education', 'education and outreach', 'educational workshop', 'family', 'family member', 'future', 'general population', 'goals', 'grant', 'group meetings', 'human', 'individual', 'institution', 'internet', 'lead', 'leadership', 'link', 'maintenance', 'medical', 'mind', 'mus', 'olfactory epithelium', 'olfactory pathways', 'pathology', 'patients', 'pennsylvania', 'periodicals', 'physicians', 'play', 'protocols documentation', 'recording of previous events', 'research', 'research design', 'research personnel', 'schizophrenia', 'science', 'series', 'services', 'site', 'societies', 'standardization', 'students', 'subgroup', 'translations', 'universities', 'update', 'validation', 'data management', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'equity, diversity, and inclusion', 'human subject', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'open data', 'operation', 'peer', 'programs', 'public education', 'recruit', 'scientific organization', 'symposium', 'web page']",,
"Project 3: ABSTRACT
Smell deficits detected by established psychophysical measures are reproducibly reported in patients with
schizophrenia (SZ). Importantly, smell deficits are correlated with specific clinical features, such as negative
symptoms (e.g., avolition, anhedonia) and some cognitive deficits (e.g., social cognitive deficits), but not with
positive symptoms (e.g., hallucination, delusion). Smell deficits are found in SZ from the early stages of the
disease, and to a milder extent, in the first-degree relatives, indicating that smell deficits are a reflection of
fundamental disease pathophysiology rather than mere secondary outcomes of confounding factors (e.g.,
medications) in SZ. The olfactory epithelium (OE) is the most peripheral component of the olfactory system,
located outside the cranium. Thus, OE is highly influenced by environmental stressors, such as viral infection
and air pollution. Molecular changes in the OE in SZ have been reported from many groups. Nevertheless,
whether and how pathological changes in OE contributes to clinical manifestation in SZ still remains to be
elucidated. We have recently obtained evidence that immune/inflammatory changes associated with redox
imbalance may be one of the most prominent alterations in the OE pathology in SZ. Furthermore, we have
observed that the OE molecular changes (inflammation, redox) are significantly correlated with OB volume
changes and negative symptoms in SZ. In parallel, we observed that a mouse model of local chronic OE
inflammation affects the pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and resultant behavioral changes
(including those in positive valence systems), which may be mediated by the olfactory-prefrontal circuits.
Based on these compelling evidence, we hypothesize that molecular and cellular changes in the OE
significantly contribute to specific clinical manifestations that correlate with smell deficits in SZ patients, which
is mediated by the olfactory-prefrontal circuits. We expect that OE pathology in SZ is a major contributory
mechanism for negative symptoms and social cognitive deficits. In this Project, we will define OE pathology in
SZ patients at the tissue level via immunohistochemistry and single-cell RNA sequencing (Aim 1). By
leveraging the homogeneity of olfactory neuronal cells (ONCs), we will further define OE pathology in SZ in
greater detail using bulk RNA sequencing and aim to identify key molecules for OE pathology in SZ (Aim 2).
By using the key molecules, we will aim to stratify SZ patients. Lastly, we will study the relationship between
OE pathology and anatomical/clinical characteristics in SZ (Aim 3). We will conduct correlation analysis and
mediation analysis by utilizing the multimodal data (OE, OB, PFC, and clinical data) from the same subjects.
We will also perform a longitudinal cohort maintenance. Through this study, we plan to establish the OE
pathology and its contributory role to negative symptoms and social cognitive deficits via the olfactory-
prefrontal circuits in early-stage SZ patients.",Project 3,,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10862178,Address;Adult;Affect;Air Pollution;Anatomy;Anhedonia;Animal Model;Attention;Back;Basal Cell;Behavioral;Biopsy;Brain;Cells;Characteristics;Chronic;Clinical;Clinical Data;Cognitive deficits;Data;Delusions;Disease;First Degree Relative;Functional disorder;Genes;Hallucinations;Human;Immune;Immunohistochemistry;Individual;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Knowledge;Longitudinal cohort;Maintenance;Measures;Mediating;Mediation;Molecular;Mus;Neurobehavioral Manifestations;Neurons;Olfactory Epithelium;Olfactory Pathways;Oxidation-Reduction;Pathologic;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Patients;Peripheral;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Positive Valence;Prefrontal Cortex;Protocols documentation;Psychophysics;Publishing;Reporting;Reproducibility;Research;Role;Schizophrenia;Smell Perception;Specificity;Study models;Symptoms;System;Tissues;Translating;Virus Diseases;cell type;cranium;environmental stressor;hippocampal pyramidal neuron;human data;interest;molecular pathology;mouse model;multimodal data;neuron regeneration;olfactory bulb;olfactory sensory neurons;patient stratification;secondary outcome;single-cell RNA sequencing;social;stem cells;transcriptome sequencing;transmission process,10862178,1P50MH136297-01,,,,,,,,"['address', 'adult', 'affect', 'air pollution', 'anatomy', 'anhedonia', 'animal model', 'attention', 'back', 'basal cell', 'behavioral', 'biopsy', 'brain', 'cells', 'characteristics', 'chronic', 'clinical', 'clinical data', 'cognitive deficits', 'data', 'delusions', 'disease', 'first degree relative', 'functional disorder', 'genes', 'hallucinations', 'human', 'immune', 'immunohistochemistry', 'individual', 'inflammation', 'inflammatory', 'knowledge', 'longitudinal cohort', 'maintenance', 'measures', 'mediating', 'mediation', 'molecular', 'mus', 'neurobehavioral manifestations', 'neurons', 'olfactory epithelium', 'olfactory pathways', 'oxidation-reduction', 'pathologic', 'pathology', 'pathway interactions', 'patients', 'peripheral', 'pharmaceutical preparations', 'positive valence', 'prefrontal cortex', 'protocols documentation', 'psychophysics', 'publishing', 'reporting', 'reproducibility', 'research', 'role', 'schizophrenia', 'smell perception', 'specificity', 'study models', 'symptoms', 'system', 'tissues', 'translating', 'virus diseases', 'cell type', 'cranium', 'environmental stressor', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'human data', 'interest', 'molecular pathology', 'mouse model', 'multimodal data', 'neuron regeneration', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory sensory neurons', 'patient stratification', 'secondary outcome', 'single-cell rna sequencing', 'social', 'stem cells', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transmission process']",,
"CORE B: ABSTRACT
Core B (Clinical and Imaging Core) will support Projects 1-3 for new clinical and translational research in
schizophrenia (SZ) and relevant animal models. Core B is built on our established cohesive and committed
team of investigators, with experts in clinical enrollment and characterization, olfactory imaging, and cortical
imaging [as a productive outcome of long-term collaboration between the Johns Hopkins Schizophrenia Center
(JHSZC) and the Center for Imaging Science (CIS) at Johns Hopkins University]. Smell deficits are one of the
most reproducible changes in SZ. One key feature of the deficits is their tight association with specific clinical
features, such as negative symptoms (e.g., avolition, anhedonia) and some cognitive deficits (e.g., social
cognitive deficits), but not with positive symptoms (e.g., hallucination, delusion). Since 2009, the NIMH
Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework has facilitated studies that focus on neurobiological processes
underlying behavioral domains/constructs, instead of considering each psychiatric diagnosis as one
homogeneous entity. One innovation of this P50 is translational research with both human and mouse studies
under specific behavioral domains/constructs of interest (mainly, positive valence systems and social
processes) in a mechanistic association with the olfactory-prefrontal circuits to account for specific clinical
domains in SZ. Thus, we will leverage the RDoC research framework to organize our research design. Based
on this framework, this Core B will assist Projects in addressing the central hypothesis that, mediated by the
olfactory-prefrontal circuits, molecular and cellular changes in the olfactory epithelium (OE) significantly
contribute to specific clinical manifestations that correlate with smell deficits in SZ patients. Accordingly, Core
B will recruit new study participants and conduct clinical assessments, combining with the existing cohort (Aim
1). We will leverage a recently established alliance of patient recruitment with the Maryland Psychiatric
Research Center (MPRC) and 10 hospitals in the MedStar Health network. We will pay a special attention to
the confounding factors associated with COVID-19 in study participant recruitment and data analysis in
collaboration with Core C (Core for data analysis). Core B will also collect and process brain imaging data
(Aim 2) to provide ex vivo mouse olfactory bulb (OB) imaging (for Project 1), process 3T resting-state
functional magnetic resonance imaging data from human healthy subjects (for Project 2), and obtain 3T
structural imaging of the OB and prefrontal cortex from newly recruited subjects in this grant proposal (for
Project 3). In summary, this Core B will acquire multimodal data from both humans and mice under a specific
scientific focus on the olfactory-prefrontal circuits.",Core B,,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10862179,Address;Anhedonia;Animal Model;Anterior;Applications Grants;Appointment;Attention;Behavioral;Biopsy;Blood specimen;Brain;Brain Mapping;Brain imaging;COVID-19;COVID-19 diagnosis;COVID-19 impact;COVID-19 vaccination;Cells;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clinical assessments;Cognitive deficits;Collaborations;Collection;Data;Data Analyses;Delusions;Disease;Enrollment;Exclusion;Exclusion Criteria;Faculty;Foundations;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Functional disorder;Generations;Goals;Hallucinations;Health;Hospitals;Human;Image;Infrastructure;Lead;Long COVID;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Maryland;Medial;Mediating;Molecular;Monitor;Mus;National Institute of Mental Health;Neurobiology;Neurons;Nose;Olfactory Epithelium;Olfactory Pathways;Outcome;Participant;Patient Recruitments;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physicians;Positive Valence;Prefrontal Cortex;Process;Productivity;Psychiatric Diagnosis;Psychiatrist;Psychiatry;Psychoses;Reproducibility;Research;Research Design;Research Domain Criteria;Research Personnel;Rest;Schizophrenia;Services;Sinus;Smell Perception;Social Processes;Statistical Data Interpretation;Symptoms;System;Time;Training;Translational Research;Universities;area striata;behavioral health;cingulate cortex;clinical imaging;cohort;data acquisition;data analysis pipeline;data management;data modeling;experience;first episode psychosis;human data;imaging facilities;imaging science;imaging study;inclusion criteria;innovation;interest;member;multimodal data;olfactory bulb;recruit;secondary outcome;social;structural imaging,10862179,1P50MH136297-01,,,,,,,,"['address', 'anhedonia', 'animal model', 'anterior', 'applications grants', 'appointment', 'attention', 'behavioral', 'biopsy', 'blood specimen', 'brain', 'brain mapping', 'brain imaging', 'covid-19', 'covid-19 diagnosis', 'covid-19 impact', 'covid-19 vaccination', 'cells', 'clinic', 'clinical', 'clinical research', 'clinical assessments', 'cognitive deficits', 'collaborations', 'collection', 'data', 'data analyses', 'delusions', 'disease', 'enrollment', 'exclusion', 'exclusion criteria', 'faculty', 'foundations', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging', 'functional disorder', 'generations', 'goals', 'hallucinations', 'health', 'hospitals', 'human', 'image', 'infrastructure', 'lead', 'long covid', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'maryland', 'medial', 'mediating', 'molecular', 'monitor', 'mus', 'national institute of mental health', 'neurobiology', 'neurons', 'nose', 'olfactory epithelium', 'olfactory pathways', 'outcome', 'participant', 'patient recruitments', 'patients', 'pharmaceutical preparations', 'physicians', 'positive valence', 'prefrontal cortex', 'process', 'productivity', 'psychiatric diagnosis', 'psychiatrist', 'psychiatry', 'psychoses', 'reproducibility', 'research', 'research design', 'research domain criteria', 'research personnel', 'rest', 'schizophrenia', 'services', 'sinus', 'smell perception', 'social processes', 'statistical data interpretation', 'symptoms', 'system', 'time', 'training', 'translational research', 'universities', 'area striata', 'behavioral health', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'data acquisition', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'human data', 'imaging facilities', 'imaging science', 'imaging study', 'inclusion criteria', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'multimodal data', 'olfactory bulb', 'recruit', 'secondary outcome', 'social', 'structural imaging']",,
"Core C: ABSTRACT
Core C will support Projects 1-3 in their data analysis, ensuring that these analyses are conducted by rigorous
methods and making the data interpretable and reproducible. Core C will pay attention to data types and
statistical power, while taking into account important confounding factors that are present in the human
population. Core C will, in addition, implement a new method called Shifting Pair Analysis (SPA), based on k-
Top Scoring Pairs (kTSP) that was originally invented by Dr. Geman (a PI of this Core) in 2004. Core C MPIs
have made fundamental contributions to computational biology (e.g., the introduction of Gibbs sampler and
random forests). Taking advantage of their expertise, Core C will provide standardized analytic pipelines for
general data analysis, such as power analysis and sample size estimation, group comparison, correlation
analysis, and other statistical analyses (Aim 1). Furthermore, Core C will provide customized analytic pipelines
and guidance for molecular data analysis (Aim 2), and neuroimaging and multimodal data analysis (Aim 3).
Core C will also provide guidelines for controlling confounding factors and biological variables in molecular,
neuroimaging, and multimodal data analyses. Core C will assist Projects 1 and 3 in investigating pathological
changes in the olfactory epithelium (OE), particularly immune/inflammatory changes and redox imbalance,
across humans and mice through immunohistochemistry, single-cell RNA-sequencing, and bulk RNA-
sequencing. To study the impact of the OE pathology on clinical manifestations in schizophrenia (SZ) via the
olfactory-prefrontal circuits, Core C will guide Project 3 to identify key molecules for the OE pathology in SZ,
sub-stratify SZ patients, and perform causal mediation analysis to study relationships among OE pathology,
olfactory-prefrontal circuits, and clinical manifestation. Core C will also guide Project 1 to analyze mouse ex
vivo brain imaging data, assist Project 2 in analyzing mouse electrophysiological data and comparing the
connectivity of the olfactory-prefrontal circuits between control mice and human healthy subjects. In addition,
Core C will guide Project 3 to conduct a pilot longitudinal study. In summary, Core C will support Projects by
central guidance in data analysis using conventional methods in psychiatry and other medical research (Aims
1-3). The other important and innovative role of Core C is to implement a new method (SPA) (Aim 4). This is a
modified version of kTSP, which has been used in cancer and other disease research, in particular enormously
contributing to biomarker exploration. But this method has not yet been applied to psychiatry. SPA is
advantageous in prioritizing key molecules in samples with high heterogeneity via analyzing relationships
between variables, which is less affected by confounding factors. SPA will be used in Projects as an
explorative approach to validate the results in a more sensitive manner. Together, Core C will provide
integrative data science support with both solid/conventional and innovative/novel analytical pipelines.",Core C,,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10862180,Address;Affect;Anatomy;Attention;Behavior;Biological;Biological Markers;Brain;Brain imaging;Cells;Clinical;Computational Biology;Data;Data Analyses;Data Science;Disease;Electrophysiology (science);Ensure;Graph;Guidelines;Heterogeneity;Human;Immune;Immunohistochemistry;Inflammatory;Instruction;Longitudinal Studies;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Mediation;Medical Research;Mental disorders;Methods;Minority;Molecular;Mus;Neurons;Olfactory Epithelium;Olfactory Pathways;Oxidation-Reduction;Pathologic;Pathology;Patients;Population;Protocols documentation;Psychiatry;Reproducibility;Research;Role;Sample Size;Sampling;Schizophrenia;Solid;Standardization;Statistical Data Interpretation;Techniques;Testing;Visit;comparison group;human data;innovation;invention;multimodal data;neuroimaging;novel;patient stratification;power analysis;predict clinical outcome;random forest;single-cell RNA sequencing;transcriptome sequencing,10862180,1P50MH136297-01,,,,,,,,"['address', 'affect', 'anatomy', 'attention', 'behavior', 'biological', 'biological markers', 'brain', 'brain imaging', 'cells', 'clinical', 'computational biology', 'data', 'data analyses', 'data science', 'disease', 'electrophysiology (science)', 'ensure', 'graph', 'guidelines', 'heterogeneity', 'human', 'immune', 'immunohistochemistry', 'inflammatory', 'instruction', 'longitudinal studies', 'malignant neoplasms', 'mediating', 'mediation', 'medical research', 'mental disorders', 'methods', 'minority', 'molecular', 'mus', 'neurons', 'olfactory epithelium', 'olfactory pathways', 'oxidation-reduction', 'pathologic', 'pathology', 'patients', 'population', 'protocols documentation', 'psychiatry', 'reproducibility', 'research', 'role', 'sample size', 'sampling', 'schizophrenia', 'solid', 'standardization', 'statistical data interpretation', 'techniques', 'testing', 'visit', 'comparison group', 'human data', 'innovation', 'invention', 'multimodal data', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'power analysis', 'predict clinical outcome', 'random forest', 'single-cell rna sequencing', 'transcriptome sequencing']",,
"Project Summary/Abstract
An estimated 12 million adolescent girls marry before the age of 18 annually, the majority of whom live in
resource-constrained environments in low and middle-income countries (LMIC). Northern Nigeria is a striking
example, with 78% of girls married before the age of 18, and 48% before the age of 15. Child marriage
worsens not only health outcomes, including early fertility, maternal morbidity and mortality, depression, and
sexually transmitted infections, but also important social determinants of health like education, social support,
and intimate partner violence. The complex and contextual determinants of child marriage mean that
successful interventions are rare, and causal evidence on the effects of delaying child marriage remains
limited, with many programs to delay child marriage focusing on a single, limited margin of intervention. A
previous cluster-randomized control trial of the Pathways intervention in northern Nigeria led to unusually large
reductions in child marriage two years post intervention by combining social, educational, and vocational
support with community-based recruitment. By generating a novel dataset from follow up surveys with the
original study participants six years after implementation, we propose not only to evaluate the effectiveness of
the Pathways program, but also to leverage this unusually successful program to generate rigorous causal
evidence on the effects of delaying child marriage. We will generate causal evidence on the intervention's
effectiveness on marital, health and related outcomes, and use cost-benefit analysis to translate the results to
policy-relevant figures, contributing to the global knowledge base on preventing child marriage and

"PROJECT SUMMARY
Approximately 100,000 Americans, primarily of African descent, live with sickle cell disease (SCD), a genetic red
blood cell (RBC) disorder characterized by a mutated hemoglobin (HbS). HbS-containing RBCs sickle when
exposed to low oxygen or hypertonic environments, precipitating acute, excruciatingly painful episodes of
vascular obstruction. Vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs) account for a 7 to 30-fold higher hospitalization rate and
a 2- to 6-fold higher rate of emergency department visits, compared to age-specific rates for Black Americans
without SCD, and adversely impact quality of life and survival. Current disease-modifying treatments for SCD
such as hydroxyurea, voxelotor, and crizanlizumab only reduce hospitalizations for VOE by 50% at most. Thus,
prevention of VOE by other means in combination with existing treatments remains crucial. Chronic dehydration
is a quantifiable and potentially actionable biomarker, which may predict morbidity and mortality in patients with
SCD. In emergency room settings, VOE is frequently accompanied by acute dehydration, which is managed by
fluid replacement. However, the prevalence of chronic dehydration during “steady-state” conditions (i.e., non-
crisis) is unknown, and it is uncertain whether mild, chronic dehydration predicts increased risk of SCD-related
morbidity or mortality. Age-associated hyposthenuria (i.e., the inability to concentrate urine), is common in SCD,
and could plausibly contribute to chronic dehydration. Although SCD is thought to induce compensatory
polydipsia (i.e., increased thirst), conflicting reports also note impaired thirst regulation, which may be sex or age
dependent. Of note, all large examinations of steady-state dehydration have been limited to infants and very
young children, excluding adolescents or adults who may be more susceptible to chronic dehydration due to
progressive renal dysfunction. Our hypothesis is that chronic dehydration is predictive of VOE, hospitalizations,
and death, and of relevance, may be suitable for monitoring to prevent VOE. To analyze the relationship between
chronic dehydration and subsequent VOE we will 1). Conduct an epidemiologic investigation, using data and
specimens available from the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD) and the more contemporary
Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea (MSH), and 2). Conduct a prospective, clinical study enrolling 50 participants
with SCD. The CSSCD and MSH are open BioLINCC studies with rich phenotyping, lengthy prospective follow
up, and adjudicated clinical events. We will use available serum specimens from these cohorts to assay serum
osmolality, a marker of dehydration. Our observations from the epidemiologic investigation will be complemented
by the prospective clinical study, which will include more granular data collection and state-of-the-art
measurements of dehydration. The knowledge to be gained from this project will establish whether chronic
dehydration during steady-state conditions is predictive of morbidity and mortality in patients with SCD and has
the potential to influence patient behavior and recommendations for care, such as at-home hydration monitoring
to encourage fluid intake for VOE prevention.",Chronic dehydration in sickle cell disease: An actionable biomarker to prevent vaso-occlusive episodes?,"RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH

"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sleep is a very well conserved behavioral state across all animals. Though the exact function of sleep remains unknown, it
is widely appreciated that good sleep quality is a cornerstone for any healthy organism. Indeed, several neurological
disorders are co-morbid with sleep disturbances. Furthermore, altered sleep as observed in sleep apnea, insomnia or sleep
deprivation show impairments in memory consolidation and increased risk for depression, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease
(AD), and other neuropsychiatric disorders. AD patients have been shown to display altered sleep architecture. Sleep plays
a role in clearance of beta-amyloid (Aβ) in interstitial space. Excessive accumulation of Aβ, a prominent feature of AD, has
been shown to alter sleep. Recent work in our lab has demonstrated that hyperexcitability of wake-promoting hypocretin
(Hcrt) neurons of the lateral hypothalamus (LH), resulting from natural aging, may underlie increased sleep fragmentation
during aging. It is likely that these same neurons may have altered excitability in AD, exacerbated by the presence of Aβ
accumulation, and may drive sleep fragmentation and sleep disturbances observed in AD patients. The overarching aim of
this proposal is to understand how Aβ accumulation impacts hypocretin neuron activity leading to altered homeostatic sleep
pressure and subsequent disrupted sleep architecture observed in Alzheimer’s disease. The central hypothesis is that
accumulation of Aβ accelerates natural Hcrt neuron death leading to hyperexcitability of surviving Hcrt neurons and
disrupted sleep pressure and architecture. This proposal focuses on Hcrt neurons as they have been suggested to be an
integration hub which consolidates several streams of input and sends signals to downstream arousal-promoting regions. To
understand this interaction, I will first need to demonstrate altered Hcrt neuron activity in the presence of Aβ accumulation,
its impact on sleep (Aim 1), and demonstrate changes to the intrinsic and synaptic excitability of Hcrt neurons (Aim 2).
Finally, I will consolidate the findings into a biophysically realistic computational network model with sleep-wake
transitions to make viable predictions about the relative contributions of various ionic / synaptic currents to changes in
intrinsic Hcrt neuron activity and its impact on overall sleep structure. These predictions will then be experimentally tested
using CRISPR-SaCas9 technologies in vivo, the results of which will then further inform/refine the computational model
(Aim 3). The end goal being a detailed theory / biophysical explanation for the impact of Aβ accumulation on Hcrt neuron
activity and their role in sleep architecture.",Contribution of hypocretin neuron activity to Alzheimer's related sleep disturbances,"PROJECT NARRATIVE

Alzheimer’s patients remains unknown, it may involve disrupted encoding of homeostatic sleep pressures by wake-
promoting hypocretin neurons of the lateral hypothalamus. In this proposal, I will investigate the impact of AD related

"Mechanism of dual NaV1.7 and NaV1.8 block by a NaV inhibitory peptide aptamer
Summary/Abstract: Multiple sensory neuronal sodium channels (NaVs) contribute to pain pathogenesis,
indicating that development of a strategy for specific block of multiple NaVs in the pathological sensory neurons
would be more effective for inhibiting pain signals than inhibiting only single NaV subtype. We discovered a
polyacidic peptide from NaV1.7 intracellular segment and voltage-clamp recording shows that this peptide
potently inhibits sodium currents conducted by both NaV1.7 and NaV1.8 (NaV1.7/1.8) channels. This dual
NaV1.7/1.8 inhibitory peptide aptamer (named 1.7/1.8iPA, 38mer) contains a conserved Ankyrin (AnkG) binding
domain and a multi-PDZ-domain protein
class I binding domain (Pdzd2-I) between NaV1.7 and NaV1.8,
suggesting that either AnkG or Pdzd2-I domain or both within 1.7/1.8iPA may contribute to its dual NaV1.7/1.8
inhibition. The overall goal of this proposal is to investigate 1) whether AnkG and/or Pdzd2-I domains in
1.7/1.8iPA is responsible for its dual NaV1.7/1.8 inhibition, and 2) whether expression of sequence defined
1.7/1.8iPA in the primary sensory neurons (PSN) will suppress PSN excitability, supporting 1.7/1.8iPA as a
potential analgesic lead. Two specific aims will be investigated to test the hypothesis that
1.7/1.8iPA elicits
dual
block of NaV1.7/1.8 currents via a combined effects of AnkG and Pdzd2-I domains, leading to suppression of
PSN action potential firing. Specific aim 1 will investigate and determine
ion channel selectivity of 1.7/1.8iPA by
in vitro of cell-based voltage-clamp recordings using HEK cells stably expressing various NaV subtypes and
NG108-15 neuronal cells that naturally express potassium channels KV7.2/7.3 (both containing conserved AnkG
binding domain). Specific aim 2 will
determine electrogenesis and biological activity (neurotoxicity and animal
behaviors) of 1.7/1.8iPA expression in the rat PSNs. Successful completion of this application will provide
sufficient data
to determine whether 1.7/1.8iPA is a potential analgesic lead to be further developed for AAV-

"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease resulting from the loss of dopaminergic
neurons in the substantia nigra. It is the second-leading neurodegenerative disease associated with aging. For
over fifty years, treatment with levodopa (L-dopa), which crosses the blood-brain barrier and is converted to
dopamine (DA), has been used to mitigate the debilitating motor symptoms associated with PD. However, there
are several caveats associated with L-dopa therapy including erratic, “on-off” cyclical relief from motor symptoms,
large individual variability in effective dose, and a loss of efficacy over time. This loss of efficacy necessitates
escalation of L-dopa dosage, with an increased risk of L-dopa induced dyskinesia. One confounding factor in L-
dopa treatment is its metabolism to DA by gut microbiota. DA produced systemically is unable to cross the blood-
brain barrier and is associated with adverse physiological effects. Although aromatic amino acid decarboxylase
inhibitors (e.g., carbidopa) are typically co-administered with L-dopa, they are ineffective against microbial
metabolism. Enterococcus faecalis, a ubiquitous member of the gut microbiome that is primarily responsible for
the bacterial metabolism of L-dopa, expresses a tyrosine decarboxylase (TyrDC) that avidly converts L-dopa to
DA and is only weakly inhibited by carbidopa. In the proposed studies, we will test the hypothesis that deletion
of the TyrDC gene from a previously engineered, bacteriocin-expressing strain of E. faecalis will abrogate L-
dopa metabolism, leading to increased L-dopa and decreased DA in the serum, and elevated DA levels in the
brain following oral L-dopa administration. In Aim 1, we will investigate colonization of the mouse gastrointestinal
tract with the newly constructed ΔtyrDC mutant and determine the impact of colonization on L-dopa and DA
concentrations in the blood and brain following oral administration of L-dopa. In Aim 2, we will address the impact
of colonization with the ΔtyrDC mutant on the efficacy of oral L-dopa therapy in alleviating motor deficits and the
development of L-dopa induced dyskinesia in a mouse model of PD. The scientific impact of these studies will
be to further elucidate the effects of gut microbial metabolism on the efficacy of oral L-dopa therapy. There is a
clear unmet need for novel approaches that enhance or extend the usefulness of L-dopa in PD treatment, and
the development of a probiotic that effectively prevents decarboxylation of L-dopa in the gastrointestinal tract
may have significant potential as an adjunct to L-dopa in the management of PD.",Modifying the microbiome to enhance L-dopa therapy in Parkinson’s disease,"PROJECT NARRATIVE
Levodopa (L-dopa) remains the front-line therapy for treatment of motor disorders associated with Parkinson’s
disease. However, metabolism by the gut microbiome reduces the concentration of L-dopa available for uptake
into the brain, complicates determination of optimal dosage, and may contribute to the need for dose escalation
over the course of the disease. Treatment with a probiotic that mitigates L-dopa metabolism by the gut
microbiome is a promising and novel approach to enhance the effectiveness of oral L-dopa therapy in
Parkinson’s disease.",https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10869308,Affect;Aging;Aromatic-L-Amino-Acid Decarboxylases;Blood;Bradykinesia;Brain;Carbidopa;Carboxy-Lyases;Decarboxylation;Development;Disease;Dopamine;Dose;Effectiveness;Engineering;Enterococcus;Enterococcus faecalis;Gastrointestinal tract structure;Genes;Indigenous;Infection prevention;Knock-out;L-DOPA induced dyskinesia;Levodopa;Measures;Mediating;Metabolism;Midbrain structure;Motor;Multi-Drug Resistance;Mus;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neurotransmitters;Operon;Oral;Oral Administration;Parkinson Disease;Patients;Physiological;Probiotics;Quality of life;Rifampicin resistance;Risk;Serum;Substantia nigra structure;System;Testing;Time;Tyrosine;Variant;Withdrawal;associated symptom;bacterial metabolism;bacteriocin;behavior measurement;blood-brain barrier crossing;decarboxylase inhibitor;dopaminergic neuron;dosage;gut microbiome;gut microbiota;improved;individual variation;member;microbial;microbiome;motor control;motor deficit;motor disorder;motor symptom;mouse model;mutant;novel strategies;posture instability;prevent;response;uptake,10869308,1R21NS137244-01,,,,,,,,"['affect', 'aging', 'aromatic-l-amino-acid decarboxylases', 'blood', 'bradykinesia', 'brain', 'carbidopa', 'carboxy-lyases', 'decarboxylation', 'development', 'disease', 'dopamine', 'dose', 'effectiveness', 'engineering', 'enterococcus', 'enterococcus faecalis', 'gastrointestinal tract structure', 'genes', 'indigenous', 'infection prevention', 'knock-out', 'l-dopa induced dyskinesia', 'levodopa', 'measures', 'mediating', 'metabolism', 'midbrain structure', 'motor', 'multi-drug resistance', 'mus', 'neurodegenerative disorders', 'neurotransmitters', 'operon', 'oral', 'oral administration', 'parkinson disease', 'patients', 'physiological', 'probiotics', 'quality of life', 'rifampicin resistance', 'risk', 'serum', 'substantia nigra structure', 'system', 'testing', 'time', 'tyrosine', 'variant', 'withdrawal', 'associated symptom', 'bacterial metabolism', 'bacteriocin', 'behavior measurement', 'blood-brain barrier crossing', 'decarboxylase inhibitor', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'dosage', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'motor disorder', 'motor symptom', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'novel strategies', 'posture instability', 'prevent', 'response', 'uptake']",,
"SUMMARY - Engineered exosomes carrying synthetic gRNA/Cas9 targeting HBV-infected cells
Despite universal vaccinations against hepatitis B virus (HBV), chronic HBV infection remains a public health threat
in the United States and worldwide. The current antiviral treatments, using various nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs), can
block the HBV life cycle but cannot eliminate integrated HBV DNA and have little effect on HBV covalently closed
circular DNA (cccDNA), which sustains viral replication. Thus, novel curative strategies are urgently needed to
eliminate HBV cccDNA from infected hepatocytes. CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
repeats)/Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9)-mediated gene-editing is an appealing approach to tackle this
problem. However, the major hurdle in the application of this technology is how to deliver gene-editing drugs to target
cells and elicit specific antiviral activities without causing off-target effects. Notably, the current CRISPR/Cas9
delivery technologies often require viral vectors, which pose safety concerns for therapeutic application in humans.
Synthetic guide RNA (gRNA)/Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) represent a novel non-viral formula with excellent
features, including rapid DNA cleavage activity, low off-target effects, no risk of insertional mutagenesis, easy
production, and readiness for clinical use. We have designed and tested a series of gRNA/Cas9 gene-editing RNPs
targeting HBV and selected the most specific and potent gRNA/Cas9 RNP candidates to abolish HBV replication in
HBV cellular models. However, the existing viral and non-viral delivery systems for gRNA/Cas9 RNPs in vivo use
face several challenges, such as non-specific (off-site) delivery, limited drug-loading capacity, low biocompatibility,
poor stability, cytotoxicity, and potential of immunogenicity. These challenges are major bottlenecks, limiting the use
of synthetic gRNA/Cas9 RNPs for in vivo applications. To address these limitations, we developed a novel exosome-
based delivery platform engineered to deliver the HBV gene-editing RNPs specifically to human hepatocytes. These
engineered exosomes are designed in such a way that they carry an HBV pre-S1-derived peptide (binding to HBV
receptor) on the surface of exosomes so that they can more specifically deliver and intracellularly release our
synthetic gRNA/Cas9 RNPs to HBV target cells. In this proposal, we aim to evaluate the capability of these exosome-
based HBV gene-editing gRNA/Cas9 RNPs (herein called Exo-HBV-Eliminator) in targeting HBV-infected
hepatocytes and investigate their antiviral efficacy and potential cytotoxicity using both cellular and animal models.
We hypothesize that our Exo-HBV-Eliminator will specifically target HBV DNA and thus efficiently abolish HBV
replication and elicit minimal cytotoxic effects both in vitro and in vivo. We propose two specific aims to test our
hypothesis. Aim 1 will determine the biophysical and biological properties of our Exo-HBV-Eliminator in vitro. Aim 2
will evaluate the antiviral and off-target effects of our Exo-HBV-Eliminator in HBV-infected, liver-humanized mice in
vivo. The objective of this study is to develop and test a novel gene therapy (engineered exosomes carrying synthetic
gRNA/Cas9 RNPs) targeting HBV cccDNA in HBV-infected hepatocytes that are incurable by the current antiviral
regimens, to lay the foundation for achieving our long-term goal of curing chronic HBV infection.",Engineered exosomes carrying synthetic gRNA/Cas9 targeting HBV-infected cells,"NARRATIVE
Patients with HBV infection are subject to prolonged (often lifelong) treatment due to the lack of curative therapeutics.
Thus, multimodal, robust therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to eliminate HBV cccDNA, which sustains viral
replication and is refractory to the current antiviral regimens. Recently, we have designed and selected the most
specific and potent gRNA/Cas9 HBV gene-editing drugs using HBV cellular models. We have also developed an
exosome-based drug delivery system that can specifically deliver these synthetic gRNA/Cas9 RNP drugs to human
hepatocytes. In this proposal, we will evaluate the antiviral efficacy and any potential off-target effects of these dual
specific HBV gene-editing drugs, both in vitro and in vivo. The objective of this project is to lay the foundation for

"Project summary
This project aims to investigate a novel approach to mitigate the risk of vascular thromboses, which imposes a
significant economic burden in the US. Our strategy is to develop a technology that, by specifically targeting the
lipid-binding domains of factor X (read factor ten) and prothrombin, two essential coagulation factors, regulates
the rate at which factor Xa and thrombin are produced and, consequently, controls the formation of blood clots.
This approach is unique compared to current pharmacologic methods that either directly (DOACs) or indirectly
(heparins) target the active site of clotting proteases or impair the proper synthesis of a family of proteins to
which multiple coagulation factors belong (warfarin). We propose this approach will offer potential benefits for
patients with prothrombotic antiphospholipid antibodies who experience limited effectiveness with existing
medications. Antiphospholipid antibodies are a defining feature of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), which is an
acquired autoimmune disorder. Additionally, there is evidence of their involvement in infectious diseases,
including COVID-19. By using an in vitro selection process, our preliminary studies identified a nanobody suitable
for testing this hypothesis, which we called NanoProTEN. Aim 1 of this project aims to investigate the biochemical
characteristics of NanoProTEN, including its affinity and specificity towards coagulation factors and plasma
proteins involved in the blood clotting cascade. We will then assess its anticoagulant potential in human plasma
and with purified coagulation factors, and its ability to interfere with antiphospholipid antibodies. These studies
will define the molecular interactions of NanoProTEN, evaluate its potential off-target effects, and establish its
anticoagulant potential compared to existing therapies. Studies in Aim 2 will define the unique mechanism of
action of NanoProTEN through structural studies using cryo-electron microscopy. By determining the structures
of NanoProTEN bound to prothrombin and factor X, we will uncover the structural elements contributing to its
dual selectivity. These studies will determine how NanoProTEN interacts with these factors, offering mechanistic
insights into its mode of action and providing essential information for enhancing its activity. In conclusion, the
primary outcome of this research project is the development of an innovative technology represented by
NanoProTEN. This technology holds promise as a versatile research tool and a potential candidate for a new
class of anticoagulants for improving outcomes in patients with prothrombotic autoantibodies and potentially
other thrombotic disorders.","Introducing NanoProTEN, a novel approach for anticoagulation in patients with prothrombotic autoantibodies","Project narrative

"Project Summary:
Reduced bone strength is a hallmark of many bone disorders, including osteoporosis, a debilitating disease
affecting millions of Americans. The strength of bone is influenced by multiple characteristics of bone including
microarchitecture, biomechanical properties (e.g., stiffness), and bone mineral density (BMD). Genome-wide
association studies (GWASs) have successfully identified over 1100 independent associations for BMD.
However, BMD is the only bone strength trait investigated using large-scale GWASs. This is largely due to the
inability to directly measure bone strength in vivo and quantify other strength-related traits in humans at scale.
The sole focus on BMD has limited the development of a comprehensive understanding of the genetics of
bone strength. Here, we propose to use Diversity Outbred (DO) mice to address this limitation. We will perform
GWAS in ~5792 mice (an ~9-fold increase in our current sample size) to significantly increase our power for
association detection. The following three specific aims will identify novel genes influencing bone strength. In
Aim 1, we will perform GWAS for bone strength and multiple strength-related traits in 5792 DO mice and utilize
an extensive set of transcriptomics data on bone to identify causal genes. In Aim 2, we will use DO bone
strength mapping data to inform human bone mineral density GWAS. In Aim 3, we will validate the role of
multiple candidate genes using in vitro and in vivo approaches. We will begin by investigating the role of eyes
absent homolog 4 (Eya4) in the regulation of bone strength. In this project we will significantly expand a proven
resource to discover new genes impacting bone strength – the most clinically relevant feature of bone, but one
that cannot be studied directly in humans. Our approach will significantly expand gene discovery efforts and
has the potential to identify dozens of new bone strength loci. These efforts will not only increase our
understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying bone strength, but point to new therapeutic targets for
the prevention and treatment of low bone strength and skeletal fragility.",Large-Scale Genetic Analysis of Bone Strength in Diversity Outbred Mice,"Project Narrative: Osteoporosis is a major public health burden and a condition characterized by decreased

"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hypothyroidism is a common disorder that requires lifelong treatment with thyroid hormone replacement.
Levothyroxine (LT4), a sodium salt of the thyroid hormone thyroxine (T4), is the recommended medication for
thyroid hormone replacement, but it fails to replicate normal thyroid physiology, which includes production of
both the thyroid hormones T4 and triiodothyronine (T3). The clinical implications of non-physiologic thyroid
hormone replacement are not clear. A substantial minority of patients with hypothyroidism have residual
symptoms of hypothyroidism despite receiving recommended doses of LT4. An adequately powered,
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of combination therapy with LT4 and T3 replacement
(LT3) is required to provide high-quality evidence to guide management of the millions of patients treated for
hypothyroidism. The goal of this proposal is to generate pilot and feasibility data required to design and lead
this definitive trial. The investigators involved in this protocol have experience in LT3 administration in both
clinical and research settings, and they have led the US-based and international guidelines that provide a
roadmap for the proposed RCT design. Data required for the design of a clinical trial of combination therapy
include refinement of the study population, dosing strategy for LT4 and LT3, primary and secondary outcome
selection, and evaluation of statistical power. We are targeting the study population to those most likely to
benefit: individuals requiring LT4 doses of at least 1.2 mcg/kg/day who have residual symptoms. We will
include important subgroups, stratifying randomization by underlying etiology of hypothyroidism (autoimmune
vs. thyroid absence) and analysis by the severity of symptoms and the presence of a genetic polymorphism
that affects metabolism of T4 to T3. We will refine the dosing strategy to ensure equivalence of thyroid
stimulating hormone (TSH) levels between LT4/LT3 and LT4/placebo groups using a novel, low-dose LT3
preparation. We will refine primary and secondary outcome selection, symptom and safety monitoring, and
obtain estimates of efficacy for sample size calculations of the large RCT. The proposed aims will provide
essential data on feasibility, preliminary efficacy, and study conduct to inform a fully powered clinical trial of
combination therapy of LT4/LT3 in patients with hypothyroidism. This definitive clinical trial would resolve the
outstanding question of whether a “more physiologic” thyroid hormone replacement regimen that includes both
LT4 and LT3 would benefit patients with residual symptoms taking current standard-of-care therapy with LT4
alone.",T4/T3 Therapy in Hypothyroidism,"PROJECT NARRATIVE

"Project Summary:
Multiple acquired and genetic conditions can lead to pathological left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). It has been
recognized for over 50 years that pathological LVH is associated with increased mortality in the human
population, and it is strongly associated with both heart failure with preserved systolic function (HFpEF) and
heart failure with reduced systolic function (HFrEF). At the tissue level, the primary cause of LVH is
cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and there are a multitude of intracellular signaling pathways involved in
hypertrophic cardiomyocyte growth. However, non-cardiomyocyte cell populations also contribute to
pathological ventricular remodeling in LVH and the downstream sequelae of this disease. Therefore, it is
critical to understand not only the primary causes of pathological cardiomyocyte growth but also how the
myocardial microenvironment responds to these changes. To uncover mechanisms regulating pathological LV
remodeling, we utilize multiple murine models that harbor sarcomere gene mutations which are common
genetic causes of LVH in humans. Previously, we discovered that loss of the sarcomere protein MYBPC3
causes rapid changes in early post-natal cardiomyocyte growth through dysregulated cell cycle pathways
causing cardiomyocyte endoreplication (DNA replication without cell division). Next, we found that
dysregulated cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity leads to replication stress induced DNA damage and activation
of DNA damage response (DDR) pathways in cardiomyocytes. We have now discovered that the DDR effector
protein, murine double mutant 2 (MDM2), plays an important role in regulating pathological LV remodeling in
both genetic and pressure overload LVH models. We hypothesize that the MDM2-HIF signaling axis is a key
regulator of pathological ventricular remodeling in genetic and acquired forms of myocardial hypertrophy. To
test this hypothesis, we will pursue the following aims: Aim 1: Define how MDM2-HIF signaling regulates
microvasculature dysfunction and LV remodeling in genetic models of LVH. Aim 2: Determine how MDM2-HIF
signaling regulates myocardial metabolism in genetic models of LVH. Aim 3: Define how cardiomyocyte
MDM2-HIF signaling regulates pathological LV remodeling secondary to pressure overload in the adult heart.
At the conclusion of these innovative and high impact studies, we will have defined a novel role for MDM2-HIF
signaling during key stages of pathological left ventricular remodeling in both genetic and acquired causes.
Through selective modulation of key components of this pathway our goal is to disrupt maladaptive myocardial
remodeling responses and uncover novel therapeutic opportunities for both genetic and non-genetic forms of
human cardiomyopathy.",MDM2-HIF signaling in pathological ventricular remodeling,"Narrative:

"Abstract: During the transition to extra-uterine life, mammalian hearts undergo a crucial metabolic shift that is
essential for neonatal hearts to adapt to normoxic conditions and the increased cardiac workload experienced
after birth. Proper metabolic transition is essential for establishing normal heart physiology. The long-term goal
of this project is to reveal the molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate this cardiac metabolic shift using
mouse models and ultimately translate our discoveries into clinical applications addressing inborn
cardiomyopathies.
 Mono-ubiquitination of histone H2A K119 (H2AK119Ub) is a major post-translational modification of
histone H2A, occurring in 5-15% of total H2A in mammalian cells. H2AK119Ub in the promoter region inhibits
RNA polymerase II elongation and acts as a repressive epigenetic mechanism to regulate key developmental
programs from drosophila to mammals. The precise level of H2AK119Ub is dynamically controlled by the balance
between ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases. USP16 is a histone H2AK119Ub-specific deubiquitinase that de-
represses gene transcription. To test the role of USP16 in hearts, we specifically deleted Usp16 in the
myocardium. All mutant mice died within 3 days after birth and displayed severe myocardial wall anomalies. Our
subsequent two-hybrid and biochemical analyses revealed that Nuclear Respiratory Factor 1 (NRF1) is a novel
USP16 interaction partner. NRF1 is a nuclear transcription factor that activates expression of the vast majority
of nuclear genes encoding subunits of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes.
 In support of the functional significance of the USP16-NRF1 interaction, our mRNA-Sequencing analysis
revealed that the pathway involved in OXPHOS was most significantly downregulated by myocardial deletion of
Usp16. We propose our central hypothesis that USP16 interacts with NRF1 to upregulate expression of nuclear
OXPHOS genes, supporting the metabolic shift in perinatal hearts. In Aim 1, we will test how deletion of Usp16
affects the metabolic shift in perinatal hearts. In Aim 2, we will test if OXPHOS genes are major direct regulatory
targets of USP16 in perinatal hearts using high-throughput approaches. In Aim 3, we will test the role of NRF1
in loading USP16 onto its target sites.
 This project will fill a major knowledge gap regarding the basic molecular mechanism underlying the
cardiac metabolic shift, which is critical for the proper transition to extra-uterine life. Our research will contribute
to the development of novel clinical applications aimed at OXPHOS-associated heart defects.",Epigenetic regulation of the metabolic shift in mammalian perinatal hearts,"In this study, we will test the function of USP16 in regulating expression of OXPHOS genes during the

"In the US, ~100,000 babies are born premature at <34 weeks gestational age (GA) each year, or ~2.7% of all
live births. While infant preterm respiratory, pulmonary vascular, and systemic vascular diseases are common
among those born preterm, many become asymptomatic in early childhood. Yet, emerging data point to
subclinical abnormalities among adult survivors of preterm birth that may ultimately drive their increased rates
of long-term cardiopulmonary complications including obstructive lung disease, pulmonary and systemic
hypertension, and metabolic disease including diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome. Preterm-born young
adults have systemic evidence of energy metabolism dysregulation, insulin insensitivity and oxidative stress.
This application has four objectives: 1) Understand the cardiopulmonary phenotypic burden of disease among
formerly preterm children (FPC) ages 5-12 years; 2) Evaluate for systemic evidence of metabolic dysregulation
characterized by inflammation, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance in FPC; 3) Explore mechanisms by
determining whether FPC have systemic molecular signatures of abnormal energy metabolism and
inflammation; and, 4) Incorporate metrics of social determinants of health (SDOH), to understand how
exposures interact with and modify the clinical condition as well as systemic and cellular features. There is a
critical need to determine the burden of disease and mechanistic features during mid-childhood, when early
interventions may change an otherwise predetermined lifespan trajectory toward chronic illness. We propose a
strategy of dense clinical phenotyping paired with molecular studies and information about SDOH. We will
leverage the clinical and research infrastructures built at our three centers over the past twenty or more years
in the care and study of children born preterm. We hypothesize that school age FPC display systemic
metabolic energy dysregulation, characterized by inflammation, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance, with
associated cardiopulmonary abnormalities and suboptimal reactivity to stress challenge, and that these
outcomes may be modified by social determinants of health (SDOH). Establishing a new human cohort of 100
FPC ages 5-12 years, matched by 50 formerly term healthy controls, we will pursue the following Aims: Aim 1:
identify the clinical cardiopulmonary vascular features that characterize FPC; Aim 2: identify the biochemical
markers in circulation that suggest metabolic dysregulation characterized by inflammation, oxidative stress,
and insulin resistance; Aim 3: deeply explore mechanistic drivers by generating expression data from RNA
Sequencing to determine the molecular variations that drive alterations in energy metabolism. In each Aim, we
will integrate the phenotypic, biochemical, and molecular variations with socio-ecologic exposures. These
studies will confirm the presence of cardiopulmonary irregularities among FPC in mid-childhood and connect
these phenotypes with alterations in biochemical and expression markers, as well as SDOH, offering the
foundation for future studies and a step toward personalizing care and surveillance guided by biologic data.",Clinical and Biochemical Features of Metabolic Dysregulation in Formerly Preterm Children,"PROJECT NARRATIVE
Preterm birth is common in the U.S., with tremendous impact upon children and families. While many go on to
productive lives, growing evidence suggests adult disease manifestations for the formerly preterm—yet, we
have limited understanding of the impact and mechanistic drivers among formerly preterm children (FPC). This

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a debilita�ng neurodegenera�ve disorder with a cri�cal need for
improved therapeu�c strategies. One controversial component of AD progression is the role of microglia,
the brain's immune cells. Recent research indicates a subpopula�on of these cells exhibi�ng senescence
characteris�cs, raising the ques�on if these senescent microglia might contribute to AD progression
through a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Our proposal aims to elucidate the role of
these cells in AD using a two-fold approach: deﬁning and characterizing these senescent microglia through
proteomic, transcriptomic, and spa�al-omics proﬁling (Aim 1) and inves�ga�ng whether removing these
senescent microglia can slow or delay AD progression (Aim 2). We plan to leverage a novel transgenic
mouse model to selec�vely ablate newly iden�ﬁed senescent microglia and assess the subsequent impact
on AD progression. If successful, these studies could oﬀer novel insight into AD pathology and iden�fy
poten�al therapeu�c targets by focusing on the selec�ve elimina�on of senescent microglia.",Investigating the Impact of Novel Senescent Microglia in Alzheimer's Disease Progression,"Lay summary:

"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Background: Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (allo-HCT) remains the only curative therapy for many
aggressive malignancies and is increasingly used for non-malignant disorders. Success is limited by 1) relapse
due to insufficient graft-vs-tumor (GVT) activity and 2) graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). Current GVHD therapies
predispose to infection and relapse. Understanding the mechanisms that optimize GVT activity and mitigate
GVHD remains a critical unmet need. Donor T-cells are essential to the allogeneic immune response. De novo
DNA methylation by DNMT3a allows activated T-cells to acquire patterns of gene expression that define
alloreactivity. Human donor DNMT3a mutations result in decreased relapse, increased GVHD, and improved
survival in HCT recipients. Based on a large body of preliminary data, both GVHD and GVT activity significantly
depend upon DNA methylation, the role of which is largely unknown in the HCT context. I hypothesize that
targeting epigenetically controlled pathways can skew allogeneic immunity away from host and towards tumor.
Design: Mice with cell-lineage specific DNMT3a deletion will be used as donors in well-established, clinically
relevant, murine models of HCT. Following HCT, donor cells will be isolated from recipient mice and undergo
whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) in parallel. This novel approach,
proven to be feasible and successful in my preliminary work, produces a comprehensive epigenetic and
transcriptomic profile of the cells directly involved in the pathogenesis of GVHD and the GVT effect. Importantly,
this method readily identifies the pathways that are dysregulated in the absence of DNMT3a.
Aim 1: Target epigenetically regulated pathways to mitigate GVHD. Dnmt3a KO donor T-cells accelerate GVHD.
WGBS and RNAseq post-HCT identified multiple pathways, normally silenced by DNMT3a, that may contribute
to this phenomenon. We will explore these putative novel targets, starting with CCR9, a chemokine receptor that
guides T-cells to the intestine, a major GVHD target organ.
Aim 2: Determine the contribution of myeloid cell DNMT3a deletion to enhanced GVHD and GVT activity.
Myeloid-derived cells hold significant immunoregulatory potential. The impact of myeloid DNMT3a deletion is
unknown. We will use donors with myeloid Dnmt3a deletion to test this.
Aim 3: Identify genes that distinguish beneficial GVT activity from harmful GVHD via epigenetic and
transcriptomic comparative analyses. In GVT models, where allo-HCT is performed in the presence of leukemia,
KO T-cells provide superior disease control. We will apply WGBS and RNAseq to interrogate how the presence
of tumor alters the epigenome and identify the changes that allow KO T-cells to better eradicate leukemia.
My long-term goal is to become an independent laboratory-based clinician-scientist, focusing on complications
of HCT and novel therapeutic approaches. My aims and training plan have been specifically and thoughtfully
crafted to provide me with the research skills and experience needed to reach this goal.",Donor DNMT3a-mediated regulation of Graft-vs-Host-Disease and the Graft-vs-Tumor effect in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation,"PROJECT NARRATIVE

"The lipid peroxidation byproduct acrolein (systematic name: propenal), is a highly toxic aldehyde that exerts
strong toxic effects by covalently binding to surrounding macromolecules, such as proteins, RNA, DNA, and
lipids. Due to the toxicity, cellular mechanisms evolved to detoxify acrolein by quenching acrolein and turning it
into a non-toxic compound. In the CNS, acrolein is quenched by carnosine. Carnosine is generated by the
enzyme Carnosine synthase 1 (Carns1). Aging is associate with reduced levels of carnosine in the brain.
Restoring carnosine levels through food supplementation with carnosine restores the age-related reduction in
brain activity in both mouse models and human patients. Elevated levels of the toxicant acrolein were found in
the brains of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients at the preclinical stage, suggesting that lack of acrolein de-
toxification by carnosine contributes to the pathogenesis at early stages of the disease. Nevertheless, the role
carnosine-mediated detoxification in AD disease etiology is unknown, partially due to lack of appropriate
experimental models. In this proposal we will develop genetic mouse models that will enable us to reduce the
levels of carnosine specifically in the CNS, to explore the role of carnosine in aging and in AD etiology.
In our preliminary studies, we found that the enzyme Carns1 is expressed in the CNS solely by mature
oligodendrocytes. Although carnosine is a ubiquitous metabolite in the body, we found that oligodendrocyte-
specific ablation of Carns1 dramatically reduces the level of carnosine in the CNS, suggesting that
oligodendrocytes are the sole source of carnosine in the CNS. We also found that oligodendrocyte-derived
carnosine protects the CNS from inflammation and reduces the spread of damaged areas marked by acrolein
adducts. In this proposal we hypothesize that oligodendrocyte-derived carnosine play a fundamental role in
acrolein accumulation in the CNS of aged and AD patients.
We will develop new genetic tools to explore the link between oligodendrocytes-derived carnosine, aging, and
AD. In the first aim we will develop Carns1 conditional allele that will enable us to reduce carnosine levels
specifically in the CNS. In the second aim we will explore the role of oligodendrocyte-derived carnosine in disease
progression in two mouse models of amyloid pathology.",Development of new tools to explore the role of oligodendrocyte-derived carnosine in Alzheimer Disease,"Currently it is unknow if the reduced carnosine and increased toxic acrolein reported in AD patients and in murine

"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
When the future has little value, impulsive choices abound. Steeply discounting the future means a drug-high
now is more valuable than future health, wealth and relationships. A large and robust literature reveals that
steeply discounting the future is correlated with early substance use, substance-use disorders, and poor
outcomes in drug-treatment trials. A small literature suggests that reducing delay discounting improves clinical
outcomes in humans. Such findings have motivated nonhuman research seeking to discover interventions that
can reduce impulsive decision-making. Those interventions might be adapted to prevention programs designed
to reduce childhood impulsivity and adolescent substance use. A practical limitation of the effective nonhuman
interventions (some of them conducted in our lab) is their duration (median = 123 operant-training sessions). In
preliminary studies, we have obtained comparable reductions in rats' impulsive choice in a fraction of the time
by using Pavlovian training methods. When Pavlovian training is complete (8 sessions), the newly established
conditioned stimulus (CS) may be used as an antecedent to attract the rat toward the self-control choice; this
significantly reduces impulsivity. The CS may also be used as a conditioned-reinforcing consequence that
significantly increases future self-control choices. These practical interventions and clinically relevant
improvements have obvious translational potential. Before undertaking that translational research, however, we
propose two experiments designed to explore how parametrically manipulating training variables known to
influence Pavlovian learning impacts the efficacy of these CS-as-antecedent and CS-as-consequence
interventions. The knowledge gained from this project will provide a roadmap to guide the design of Pavlovian
interventions seeking to prevent impulsive decision-making, and prevent the health deficits associated with those
choices.",Pavlovian Approaches to Promoting Self-Control,"PROJECT NARRATIVE

"Project summary/Abstract
Our long-term objectives are to define the complex mechanisms responsible for brain damage and repair
following neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI), as a model for neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in
term infants, and to search for novel and specific diagnostic and therapeutic targets for HIE.
Inflammation is a hallmark of HI brain injury, during which brain resident microglia play critical roles in both
induction and resolution of the inflammatory responses. We recently observed a striking buildup of cholesterol-
containing lipid droplets in microglia (lipid-laden microglia) in the injured areas following HI in the neonatal
mice, as well as in human HIE patients. In this proposal, we study how abnormal lipid accumulation and
defective clearance of cholesterol in microglia affect their normal function and neuroinflammation after neonatal
HI. We focus on cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (ch25h), which converts cholesterol to 25-hydroxycholesterol for
clearance, and plays multiple roles in reducing intracellular cholesterol overload. We hypothesized that ch25h
is critical for the maintenance of microglial homeostasis and attenuation of neuroinflammation
following neonatal brain HI. In Aim1, we will assess how ch25h regulates microglial lipid accumulation and
function in HI-injured neonatal brain. We will delete ch25h selectively in microglia and investigate the direct
effects on lipid accumulation in microglia, microglial phagocytic ability, as well as the production of cytokines
and reactive oxygen species. The contribution of microglial ch25h to brain injury are determined at early phase
after HI. In Aim 2, to begin dissecting the mechanisms by which ch25h regulates microglia phenotype after
neonatal HI, we will characterize the transcriptional profiles of microglia with unperturbed or deficient ch25h in
the sham and HI-injured brain using translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) technology followed by
RNA-sequencing.
This is the first study of the crosstalk between cholesterol metabolism and microglial immunity using a clinically
relevant mouse model of HIE. By addressing this important gap in knowledge in perinatal brain injury, we will
improve our understanding of how lipid regulation/processing in microglia controls their innate immune and
inflammatory responses, and contributes to brain damage/recovery. The results of this study could inform
novel therapeutic opportunities for neonatal brain injury by targeting microglial lipid metabolism.",A critical role for microglial cholesterol 25-hydroxylase in regulating neuroinflammation following neonatal brain hypoxia-ischemia,"Project Narrative

"Project summary: The overarching goals of this project are to image human white-matter circuitry ex vivo with
cutting-edge technologies, including ultra-high gradient-strength diffusion MRI (dMRI) and direct
measurements of axonal orientations with polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT); and
use the microscopic-scale PS-OCT data to inform the development of more accurate algorithms for
reconstructing brain circuitry from mesoscopic-scale dMRI. In the previous funding cycle, we constructed a
unique, 48-channel receive array coil for imaging whole human brains on the 3T Connectome MRI scanner
with high sensitivity at sub-mm resolution; we blocked human brains and imaged small samples with even
higher-resolution dMRI in a pre-clinical scanner; and we compared the mesoscopic diffusion orientation
estimates obtained from different q-space sampling schemes and reconstruction methods to microscopic
measurements of in-plane axonal orientations from PS-OCT. This work provided us with several insights on
the fiber configurations that are most challenging to dMRI techniques, as well as the relative contribution of
acquisition parameters such as spatial and angular resolution to the accuracy of dMRI. In the next funding
cycle, we propose to extend this work in ways that will allow us to use the optical microscopy data not only to
assess the accuracy of existing dMRI analysis methods, but also to engineer the next generation of methods.
First, we will use a modified PS-OCT setup that will allow us to measure not only in-plane but 3D orientations.
Second, we will extend our ex vivo dMRI data acquisition to allow microstructural modeling, and we will use the
ground-truth axonal orientations from PS-OCT to investigate whether MR-based microstructural indices are
continuous along axon bundles and different between bundles, i.e., to test the basic premise of microstructure-
guided tractography. Third, we will use the dMRI and PS-OCT data to train models for classifying different fiber
configurations (crossing, branching, turning, etc) directly from dMRI. The ultimate goal of the proposed data
acquisition and algorithmic development is to explore alternative (model-based or model-free) approaches to
tackling the ambiguities that lead to errors in conventional dMRI tractography methods. This project will take
advantage of the cutting-edge imaging technologies available at the MGH Martinos Center, and an
investigative team with complementary expertise in tractography, microstructural analysis, and optics. The PI
has a track record of developing open-source software tools and, during the previous cycle, spearheaded the
IronTract Challenge, with the participation of tractography developers from 20 institutions worldwide. We will
continue these practices of sharing software and data, as well as engaging the research community, during the
next cycle. The proposed work will produce (i) a unique set of post mortem MRI and optical imaging data that
can provide new insights on the relationship between fiber architectures and dMRI signals, and (ii) novel
algorithms that can take advantage of these data to improve the reconstruction of brain circuitry from dMRI.",Mapping human neurocircuitry across scales with diffusion MRI and optical imaging,"Project narrative: This project will image the fiber pathways that form the circuitry of the human brain with

"Project Summary-Abstract
Tumor microenvironment (TME) consists of many cell types that co-exist to promote tumor progression. Most
cancer therapeutics are designed to target one molecule in one defined cell type. For example, vemurafenib
(BRAF inhibitor) kills melanoma cells through targeting mutated BRAF; whereas pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1
antibody) blocks PD-1 on T cells, re-activating anti-tumor immunity. Our overarching goal is to identify targetable
molecules/pathways that are critical for multiple cell types within the TME. Using the published single cell
RNAseq (scRNAseq) datasets, we searched for these molecules/pathways meeting the following criteria: 1) they
should have important functions in cancer cells and immune suppressive cell types such as regulatory T cells
(Tregs), exhausted T cells (Texh), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) etc.; 2) they are not important
for effector function of major immune cells such as effect T cells (CD4+ or CD8+ Teff) or nature killer cells (NK);
3) they should be targetable with known inhibitors. NR4A1 fits all 3 criteria and represents a valid target for
cancer immunotherapy. In the current proposal, we intend to use proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC)
technology to develop a first-of-its-kind NR4A1 degrader for melanoma therapy. Aim 1. Rational design of novel
celastrol-based NR4A1-Ps by modifying celastrol and linkers. Aim 2. Determine cellular and molecular
mechanisms by which NR4A1-Ps work to inhibit melanoma. Aim 3. Explore the therapeutic potential of NR4A1-
Ps as a single agent or in combination. The outcome is to define the rationale for the future clinical translation of
NR4A1-Ps to enhance ICI therapy responses in melanoma.",Proteolysis targeting chimera against nuclear receptor NR4A1 for melanoma therapy,"Project Narrative

"Glioblastoma WHO IV (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor with about 8500
cases diagnosed each year in the United States. Within a time frame of roughly one year
almost all patients succumb to this detrimental disease despite treatment. Therefore,
novel, ideally tumor specific approaches are necessary to combat these tumors. Tumor
growth is ultimately determined by nutrients. We have shown before that lactate
accumulates to a significant amount in GBMs and that lactate rescues a broad range of
GBM cells from nutrient deprivation mediated cell death, which is dependent on the
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Through interrogation of genome wide pooled CRISPR
library screens performed in GBM models, we unexpectedly found that OGDH (2-
oxoglutarate dehydrogenase), a key enzyme of the TCA-cycle, is a critical driver gene
for glioblastoma growth. Using a clinically validated OGDH inhibitor (CPI-613) we found
that this drug extended animal survival. We will take these findings further and extend
our research in the underlying mechanisms and will assess the overall hypothesis that
the standard of care is enhanced by loss of function of OGDH, involving appropriate
pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic analyses. The knowledge generated from this

"PROJECT ABSTRACT:
 While antiretroviral therapy has significantly increased lifespan of people with HIV (PWH),
heightened rates of cardiovascular comorbidities continue to occur in this population as compared to
HIV-seronegative individuals. The mechanistic basis of this elevated cardiovascular disease (CVD)
risk in PWH remains poorly understood and constitutes a barrier to devising effective treatments.
Hypertension increases CVD risk and recent work has uncovered a role for gut microbial metabolism
in modulating hypertension. The gut microbiota is significantly altered in antiretroviral-treated PWH,
and the most robustly observed change in the HIV-associated gut microbiota is a depletion of
microbes capable of metabolizing dietary fiber into short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Prior work from
outside the realm of HIV research suggests a depletion of SCFAs can cause increased blood
pressure and consequently increase cardiovascular disease incidence. Whether the loss of gut
microbial SCFA producers in PWH contributes to elevated cardiovascular disease risk remains an
important but unexplored question. Through this Catalyst Award, I will test the impact of the HIV-
associated gut microbiota on bioavailable SCFA production and investigate effects of fiber
fermentation on hypertension and manifestations of cardiovascular disease using a combination of
murine gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free models, omics technologies, and computational
biology. Mechanisms of host SCFA uptake and utilization as well as methods to augment SCFA
production within the HIV-associated microbiota will be explored to identify pathways that can be
targeted to alleviate hypertension in PWH. This high-risk series of studies have potential to elucidate
mechanisms of CVD risk in PWH and identify microbiota-directed therapeutic modalities.",Gut microbiota-mediated fiber fermentation in HIV-associated cardiovascular disease,"PROJECT NARRATIVE:
 Hypertension and cardiovascular disease occur at substantially greater rates in optimally
treated people with HIV, though the etiology of this elevated comorbidity risk remains poorly
understood. The gut microbiota of people with HIV exhibits a loss of microbes that metabolize dietary
fiber into key metabolites that can ameliorate hypertension. We will investigate the dynamics of fiber
metabolism and uptake in the setting of HIV, the role of these phenomena in cardiovascular
comorbidities, and whether capacity for fiber metabolism can be restored within the HIV-associated
gut microbiome.",https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10915883,Anti-Retroviral Agents;Award;Biological Availability;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cardiovascular Manifestation;Cardiovascular system;Computational Biology;Dietary Fiber;Etiology;Exhibits;Fermentation;Fiber;Gnotobiotic;HIV;Hypertension;Incidence;Individual;Longevity;Mediating;Metabolism;Methods;Microbe;Modality;Modeling;Mus;Pathway interactions;Persons;Population;Production;Research;Risk;Role;Series;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Volatile Fatty Acids;Work;antiretroviral therapy;blood pressure elevation;cardiovascular disorder risk;catalyst;comorbidity;effective therapy;germ free condition;gut microbiome;gut microbiota;high risk;microbial;microbiota;uptake,10915883,1DP1HL174182-01,,,,,,,,"['anti-retroviral agents', 'award', 'biological availability', 'cardiovascular diseases', 'cardiovascular manifestation', 'cardiovascular system', 'computational biology', 'dietary fiber', 'etiology', 'exhibits', 'fermentation', 'fiber', 'gnotobiotic', 'hiv', 'hypertension', 'incidence', 'individual', 'longevity', 'mediating', 'metabolism', 'methods', 'microbe', 'modality', 'modeling', 'mus', 'pathway interactions', 'persons', 'population', 'production', 'research', 'risk', 'role', 'series', 'technology', 'testing', 'therapeutic', 'volatile fatty acids', 'work', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'blood pressure elevation', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'catalyst', 'comorbidity', 'effective therapy', 'germ free condition', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'microbial', 'microbiota', 'uptake']",,
"Project Abstract/Summary
 Motion related artifacts are a significant source of cost to the healthcare system. With over 12,000 MRI
scanners in the U.S. and estimates that $434,000 are lost per scanner each year, motion in MRIs is costing our
health care system approximately $4B yearly. Our FDA-cleared software solution Framewise Integrated Real-
Time MRI Monitoring (FIRMM) mitigates data lost due to motion. However, the majority of paying customers so
far are academic neuroimaging research centers; to ensure the commercial success of FIRMM, we need to
expand the customer base to advanced brain mapping for clinical care. The goal of this CRP application is to
fill the remaining gap in FIRMM’s path to clinical commercialization success by partnering with Philips to
complete and verify FIRMM and FIRMM-pix integration with their scanner environment. Pediatric advanced
brain mapping will serve as the initial proof-of-principle clinical market.
 Leading hospitals and device manufacturers have expressed enthusiasm to use FIRMM for clinical
care; however, two main barriers to clinical adoption remain: a reduction in technician critical decision making
and availability of a collection of motion tracking enabled navigator sequences for clinical care. Amongst the
leading MRI manufacturers, Philips has a specific focus on pediatric brain imaging, which includes patient
comfort solutions. Philips’ pulse sequence programming environment is unique in that it allows the addition of
navigator pulses to exciting sequences much more easily than competitors such as Siemens and GE.
Integrating FIRMM and FIRMM-pix navigated sequence package will create the first complete software-based
motion mitigation solution for clinical brain mapping. Integrating the FIRMM tablet Philips' will lead to a more
seamless integration into existing workflows; thus reducing the disruption to existing complex clinical
workflows.
 In addition, integrating the FIRMM tablet with Philips will help facilitate the wide-spread adoption of
FIRMM/-pix in the clinical market by obtaining widespread visibility via potential co-marketing with Philips and
other medtech companies. This CRP is perfectly positioned to put FIRMM and its subsequent products on a
pathway to long-term success.",Commercialization readiness of motion-robust brain MRI for pediatric healthcare,"Project Narrative

"Platelets are critical in maintaining hemostasis and platelet counts are tightly regulated in healthy individuals. In
several pathologies, the disruption of thrombopoiesis leads to abnormal platelet counts which significantly
impact clotting and/or bleeding risks. Thrombopoietin (TPO) signaling through the myeloproliferative leukemia
virus (MPL) receptor is the only known driver of megakaryocyte (MK) differentiation and maturation from
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). However, therapies targeting the TPO/MPL axis do not work for all patients,
leading to an unmet need for identifying new targets to modulate platelet counts. We have found that
membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in MK progenitors regulate MK development and platelet
production, representing a novel target for modulating megakaryopoiesis and platelet count. Our main
hypothesis is that MKs and their progenitor cells utilize the CD36 receptor to take up PUFAs from exogenous
sources, and accumulation of membrane PUFAs is essential for maintaining normal MK development and
platelet count. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims using novel techniques such as click
chemistry, cellular barcoding and phospho-flow cytometry, and the newly published Fatty Acid Library for
Comprehensive ONtologies (FALCON) platform paired with human and murine in vitro models, in vivo murine
models, and human iPSC-derived organoids. Aim 1 will determine the cell-type-specific enzyme requirement
for PUFA accumulation during megakaryopoiesis. We will use in vivo and in vitro models to determine which
enzymes play a role in PUFA accumulation in MKs and whether they are viable targets to manipulate MK
development. Aim 2 will reveal if the CD36 receptor preferentially takes up PUFAs at the expense of saturated
fatty acids. We will use CD36-/- mice and a novel in vivo click-chemistry technique to provide the first in vivo
evidence of selective PUFA uptake. We will determine if CD36 within MKs and MK progenitors preferentially
promotes the internalization of fatty acids with a specific saturation status and whether this process is impacted
by dietary fatty acid composition. Aim 3 will examine the mechanisms by which PUFA uptake influences
megakaryopoiesis. This inquiry will be addressed using 1) a targeted approach focusing on MPL signaling via
interaction with membrane lipids and 2) a hypothesis-generating approach using the FALCON platform to
generate new leads into potential TPO-independent MK differentiation pathways impacted by fatty acids.
Successful completion of the proposed experiments will extend the discovery of the role of membrane PUFAs
in MK development and platelet production to reveal a detailed and actionable roadmap of the mechanisms by
which both human and murine MKs and progenitors accumulate and utilize PUFAs to drive platelet production,
potentially leading to therapeutic and dietary interventions to modulate platelet production for patients with
diverse thrombotic and platelet disorders.",Elucidation of the mechanisms by which fatty acids drive megakaryopoiesis,"Project Narrative
While platelets are critical for maintaining hemostasis and vascular integrity, there is a significant unmet need
in identifying new targets that modulate platelet counts from their precursor cells, megakaryocytes. We recently
discovered that membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in megakaryocyte progenitors regulate
megakaryocyte development and platelet production and represent a novel target for modulating
megakaryopoiesis and platelet counts. The experiments outlined in this proposal will provide a detailed and
actionable roadmap of the mechanisms by which both human and murine megakaryocytes and progenitors
accumulate and utilize PUFAs to drive platelet production so that we can ultimately enhance and/or fine tune

"General Introduction, Abstract
Smell deficits are one of the most reproducible changes in patients with schizophrenia (SZ). They are tightly
correlated with specific clinical features, such as negative symptoms and some cognitive deficits (e.g., social
cognitive deficits), but rarely with positive symptoms. Many studies have also observed molecular and cellular
changes in the olfactory epithelium (OE) in living patients with SZ. Our group has accumulated evidence that
the immune/inflammatory changes associated with redox imbalance may be major pathological changes in the
OE of SZ patients. Nevertheless, whether and how the OE pathology mechanistically contributes to these
specific clinical features has been a major knowledge gap. Using an inducible animal model, we have
demonstrated that chronic local OE inflammation elicits a functional alteration in prefrontal cortex (PFC)
pyramidal neurons, likely via the olfactory-prefrontal circuits. As a result, the mice showed behavioral deficits in
the positive valence systems and social processes. Consistent with this basic science observation, we have
recently obtained promising results that specific molecular changes in the inflammatory/redox signaling in the
OE are directly correlated with negative symptoms (deficits of the positive valence systems) and smell deficits
in SZ patients at the cross-sectional and longitudinal levels. Altogether, we hypothesize that molecular and
cellular changes in the OE in SZ patients, or at least in a subset of them, significantly contribute to specific
clinical manifestations that correlate with smell deficits. We expect that the OE pathology alters the olfactory-
prefrontal circuits and PFC pyramidal neuron functionality, which in turn contributes to negative symptoms and
social cognitive deficits in SZ patients. We hypothesize that the impact of OE pathology on the olfactory-
prefrontal circuits is more robust in adolescence/young adulthood when the PFC maturation dynamically
happens. We propose three Projects and three Cores. Project 1 (P1) will define how OE perturbation (e.g.,
chronic local OE inflammation) elicits the neuronal alteration in the OE and OB, which results in behavioral
deficits; P2 will determine the circuitry mechanism(s) that links OE pathology to the PFC via the olfactory-
prefrontal circuits, and identify the critical developmental period vulnerable to the OE influences; P3 will define
OE pathology in early-stage SZ patients at the molecular/cellular levels, stratify patient groups depending on
the specific mechanisms (e.g., molecular expression levels), and elucidate how the OE pathology influences
specific clinical symptoms (e.g., negative symptoms and cognitive deficits) via the olfactory-prefrontal circuits.
This molecular/circuitry mechanism cannot solely be causal for these clinical deficits. Nevertheless, we
consider this mechanism as a significant contributory factor for them. Given that inflammation/redox-associated
pathology in the OE is potentially treatable with local, non-invasive interventions, we believe that this study will
provide new translational insights into these treatment-refractory clinical domains in SZ.",Impact of the olfactory system on higher brain function and schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia (SZ) is a chronic mental disease in which specific clinical domains [e.g., negative symptoms
(the lack of motivation and inability to feel pleasure) and social cognitive deficits] are particularly least
responsive to treatment, making patients’ prognosis and functionality even more devastating. Based on
promising pilot studies in our group, we hypothesize a significant contribution of the olfactory system in these
clinical domains. We will elucidate the mechanism of how the pathology of the olfactory epithelium alters the
olfactory system and, in turn, higher brain function in animal models, and then we will validate the notion in

"Project 2 Abstract
Pathological changes of the olfactory epithelium (OE) and smell deficits are reproducibly reported in
schizophrenia (SZ) patients. Notably, smell deficits are tightly correlated with negative symptoms (e.g.,
avolition, anhedonia; due to impaired positive valence systems) and social cognitive deficits, but not with
positive symptoms (e.g., hallucination, delusion) in SZ. However, a conceptual framework for explaining the
impact of the olfactory system on higher brain functions (e.g., motivation, social process, and cognition)
remains lacking. Olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in the OE project their axons to the olfactory bulb (OB),
which then transmits the information to several olfactory cortices, including the anterior olfactory nucleus/taenia
tecta (AON for simplicity) and the piriform cortex (Pir). These olfactory cortical regions subsequently project to
the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which may participate in in emergence of negative symptoms as well as in deficits
of social cognition in SZ and related disorders. Our preliminary results show that chronic local OE inflammation
leads to reduced excitatory synaptic inputs into PFC pyramidal neurons (PNs), we propose that the olfactory-
prefrontal circuits provide the causal link between OE perturbation and PFC functionality to impact higher brain
functions. Because adolescence/young adulthood is a critical period for PFC maturation, which depends on its
excitatory inputs, we will test the central hypothesis that chronic local OE perturbation during this period
leads to prolonged PFC dysfunction through the olfactory-prefrontal circuits. Specifically, we will pursue
three aims. First, we will determine the impact of OE perturbation on functional properties of PFC PNs in two
inducible OE perturbation mouse models [in collaboration with Project 1 (P1) and P3]. Using patch clamp
recordings, we will examine the effects of OE inflammation or OSN inactivation in two time windows covering
adolescence to adulthood on intrinsic electrophysiological properties and synaptic connections of PFC PNs
and aim to reverse the effects by chemogenetic activation of olfactory-prefrontal circuits. Second, we will
determine the impact of OE perturbation on PFC activity (both olfactory cortical PN terminals in PFC and PFC
PNs) via fiber photometry recording during specific mouse behaviors that assess motivation and social
recognition (in collaboration with Project 1). Third, in collaboration with Core B and Core C, we will determine
the impact of OE perturbation on functional connectivity of olfactory-prefrontal circuits in mice via in vivo
electrophysiology and compare functional connectivity between control mice and human healthy subjects (via
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging) to evaluate cross-species similarity. Overall, this project
will fill a significant knowledge gap by establishing olfactory-prefrontal circuits as a novel contributory link
between OE pathology and negative symptoms/social cognitive deficits in SZ that are currently treatment
refractory (complement P1 and P3).",Project 2,,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10862177,Adolescence;Adult;Affect;Anhedonia;Anterior;Axon;Behavior;Behavior assessment;Behavioral;Brain;Chronic;Clinical;Cognition;Cognitive deficits;Collaborations;Complement;Consultations;Data;Delusions;Disease;Electrophysiology (science);Event;Fiber;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Functional disorder;Genetic;Genus Tenia;Hallucinations;Human;Immune;Impairment;Incidence;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Knowledge;Link;Medial;Molecular;Motivation;Mus;Neurobiology;Neurons;Olfactory Cortex;Olfactory Epithelium;Olfactory Pathways;Oxidation-Reduction;Pathologic;Pathology;Patients;Photometry;Positive Valence;Prefrontal Cortex;Process;Property;Refractory;Reinforcement Schedule;Reporting;Reproducibility;Rest;Role;Schizophrenia;Smell Perception;Social Interaction;Social Processes;Symptoms;Synapses;System;Testing;Time;awake;critical period;hippocampal pyramidal neuron;human study;in vivo;insight;mouse model;neural;neural circuit;novel;olfactory bulb;olfactory nuclei;olfactory sensory neurons;patch clamp;piriform cortex;social;social cognition;social deficits;transmission process;young adult,10862177,1P50MH136297-01,,,,,,,,"['adolescence', 'adult', 'affect', 'anhedonia', 'anterior', 'axon', 'behavior', 'behavior assessment', 'behavioral', 'brain', 'chronic', 'clinical', 'cognition', 'cognitive deficits', 'collaborations', 'complement', 'consultations', 'data', 'delusions', 'disease', 'electrophysiology (science)', 'event', 'fiber', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging', 'functional disorder', 'genetic', 'genus tenia', 'hallucinations', 'human', 'immune', 'impairment', 'incidence', 'inflammation', 'inflammatory', 'knowledge', 'link', 'medial', 'molecular', 'motivation', 'mus', 'neurobiology', 'neurons', 'olfactory cortex', 'olfactory epithelium', 'olfactory pathways', 'oxidation-reduction', 'pathologic', 'pathology', 'patients', 'photometry', 'positive valence', 'prefrontal cortex', 'process', 'property', 'refractory', 'reinforcement schedule', 'reporting', 'reproducibility', 'rest', 'role', 'schizophrenia', 'smell perception', 'social interaction', 'social processes', 'symptoms', 'synapses', 'system', 'testing', 'time', 'awake', 'critical period', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'human study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'mouse model', 'neural', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory nuclei', 'olfactory sensory neurons', 'patch clamp', 'piriform cortex', 'social', 'social cognition', 'social deficits', 'transmission process', 'young adult']",,
"PROJECT SUMMARY
 In several high-income nations, including the United States, infectious syphilis has been resurgent for
over two decades now, while syphilis is still endemic in low- and middle-income countries. Syphilis is therefore
still a public global health concern, particularly because it can lead to neurological sequelae such as dementia
and stroke-like syndromes, as well as cardiovascular manifestations potentially leading to death. Furthermore,
about half a million pregnancies are adversely affected by congenital transmission of the pathogen every year.
The partial success of recent syphilis control campaigns promoted by the CDC and WHO clearly highlights the
necessity of devising novel ways to control this serious infection.
 The availability of an effective syphilis vaccine could make a significant difference in the global effort to
control the spread of this serious infection. Over the last decade, our research programs have had the focus of
identifying vaccine candidates among the surface-exposed antigens of the syphilis agent, Treponema pallidum
subsp. pallidum (T. pallidum). These studies have led to the discovery that the T. pallidum repeat (Tpr) protein
family and the Tp0751 vascular adhesin are critical proteins in the processes of chancre development/immune
evasion and systemic dissemination, respectively. When tested in immunization/challenge experiments in the
rabbit model of syphilis, these antigens were shown to provide significant protection against infection.
Furthermore, within these antigens, we have been able to pinpoint the epitopes necessary to generate a
protective host response.
 To reduce the complexity and production costs of our vaccine candidates, we have developed a
chimeric protein platform where the non-functional loops of the Tp0751 protein are exchanged with conserved
epitopes from the Tpr proteins. This approach provides a single construct that retains the critical Tp0751
epitopes while allowing presentation of protective epitopes from other antigens in a stable and soluble scaffold.
This proposal encompasses the next phase of this research endeavor consisting of Investigational New Drug
(IND)-enabling pre-clinical studies. To this end, we will create future generations of the chimera vaccine
candidate to assess the level of induced immunoreactivity and protection, after which the vaccine delivery
formulation will be optimized with the lead candidate by performing in vivo immunization/challenge
experiments, toxicity and stability tests, and studies investigating compatibility with scale-up production.
 Collectively these studies are anticipated to provide us with an efficacious syphilis vaccine candidate
that is ready for clinical studies.","Development of a Chimeric Syphilis Vaccine Candidate to Combat Local, Disseminated and Congenital Syphilis Infection","PROJECT NARRATIVE

"Project Summary
Unmeasured confounding is a major source of bias in causal inference for drug-related public policy
evaluation, and a sensitivity analysis is typically needed to examine how sensitive a related causal conclusion
is to unmeasured confounding. Existing sensitivity analysis methods are underdeveloped in drug-related policy
evaluation and can severely harm the evidence for (or against) causal claims. For example, in matched
observational studies, one of the most widely used causal inference methods in policy research, existing
sensitivity analysis methods typically focus on the case when the treatment is binary or there is a single
outcome; also, they often ignore possible subgroup-specific effects. However, many drug-related policy
measures are non-binary (e.g., ordinal or continuous), such as alcohol or tobacco tax rates, minimum legal
purchase ages, alcohol policy scores, tobacco control index, and mobility scores. Also, drug-related policies
are often evaluated using several outcomes, either those related to different types of drug use, or those related
to different aspects of society such as health, justice, and economics. Finally, due to existing disparities in
drug-related outcomes, there is an intense focus on accurately measuring the effects of drug-related policies
among subgroups defined by race and socioeconomic status. The broad objective of this project is to develop
a universal sensitivity analysis framework for unmeasured confounding in matched observational studies that
can work with binary or non-binary treatments, single or multiple outcomes, and overall or subgroup-specific
effects. There are three specific aims. Aim 1 will develop a universal sensitivity analysis framework for matched
observational studies with general (binary or non-binary) treatments. Aim 2 will further develop the sensitivity
analysis for multiple outcomes and subgroup-specific effects. Aim 3 will illustrate the proposed sensitivity
analysis by studying the causal influences of mobility policies, such as social distancing policies and
transportation policies where the measures (e.g., mobility scores) are continuous in nature, on drug-related
outcomes (e.g., drug overdose deaths, tobacco use, and excessive drinking). We will evaluate the effect on the
overall population and those among different racial groups. Aim 3 will also develop a publicly available and
user-friendly R package to implement our universal sensitivity analysis framework.",Universal Sensitivity Analysis for Unmeasured Confounding in Drug-Related Public Policy Evaluation,"Project Narrative

"PROJECT SUMMARY
The importance of complex learning, memory and verbal/symbolic processes in the
development, maintenance and relapse of substance use disorders (SUDS) is increasingly
being recognized. Drug-related cues and behaviors develop and alter in value based on direct
association with drug experiences but are also determined by verbal and other symbolic
processes. Research on these aspects of SUDS is hampered by the limited availability of
animal models of such processes. The two PIs, Dr. Galizio and Dr. Bruce, have developed a
model of symbolic processes in rats: classes of olfactory stimuli that are physically dissimilar but
are related through a history of association. Twelve odors are arbitrarily partitioned into two sets
of six. Rats are trained to make instrumental responses for reward to one set with no reward for
the other until they are responding exclusively to the rewarded set. Then reward contingencies
are repeatedly reversed and, after extensive training with these procedures, the animals begin
to show transfer of responding or non-responding to all members of each set after exposure to
just a few. This transfer of function among stimuli without direct exposure to the changed
contingencies defines a functional equivalence class and the proposed research will explore
whether these classes share key properties with human symbolic classes or categories. Aim 1
will test whether pairing of a novel stimulus with one class member will result in the novel
stimulus coming to be related to all class members without explicit training. This is called class
expansion and is readily demonstrated in humans. Aim 2 will test whether transfer of a novel
instrumental response across class members will occur in rats as they do in humans. Aim 3 will
test transfer of a Pavlovian conditioned response across class members assessed in a cue-
induced reinstatement paradigm. Finally, in a proof of concept experiment, Aim 4 will examine
whether an odor preference induced by pairing with morphine will transfer to other class
members. These studies form the basis for a model of symbolic processes in rats with potential
translational value to the treatment of SUDs.",Transfer of function across equivalence classes: Implications for substance use,"PROJECT NARRATIVE

"Project summary
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) afflicts over 6.5 million Americans and is the sixth leading cause of death in the US.
Despite more than a decade of clinical research to uncover biologic drugs to resolve negative sequelae that
accrete due to AD, no disease-modifying agents have been shown to reverse AD-related neurodegeneration for
long durations. Rather, available therapeutics aim to counter neurotransmitter imbalances that account for a
subset of AD symptoms, and more recent immunotherapies are of controversial utility that is accompanied by
severe risks of edema. While deaths from stroke, HIV, and heart disease have decreased over the last two
decades, reported deaths from AD have more than doubled over the same period, reflecting a need for
innovations in AD treatment. Genetic engineering strategies and cell-based therapies aim to supply or stimulate
neural precursors, enhance structural neuroplasticity, and combat neuronal death, and therefore offer an avenue
to potentially turn the tide of neurodegeneration and resolve aspects of AD. However, to date, none of these
therapies has proven effective and have instead highlighted the need to find methods to dynamically control
behaviors of cells in the central nervous system (CNS) in accordance with signatures of pathology. Here, we
propose to investigate engineered astrocytes and microglia as programmable agents for disease-dependent
coordination of neuro-protective behaviors. Microglia and astrocytes play central roles in the CNS response to
amyloid-b (Ab) and hyperphosphorylated tau – the biochemical hallmarks of AD – making them attractive
candidates to selectively train for pre-defined functions in response to pathologic AD features. Thus, we aim to
develop a synthetic biology tool that allows astrocytes and microglia to produce biologic drugs in targeted CNS
sites displaying Ab-related signatures of AD pathology. In Aim 1, we will investigate whether our receptor platform
programs astrocytes within an organotypic slice culture to respond to Ab with engineered outputs that can
support neuronal health. In Aim 2, we will test whether our synthetic signaling module enables engineered
astrocytes and microglia to protect neurons and counteract Ab-driven degeneration in an in vitro stem cell model
of AD. Collectively, these experiments will establish the utility of an orthogonal signaling channel that governs

"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is an incurable, progressive chronic respiratory disease, and a
leading cause of death in the United States. COPD is a heterogenous syndrome, characterized by diverse clinical
and pathologic manifestations of COPD that vary amongst susceptible individuals. Growing evidence suggests
COPD is characterized by the presence of aberrant cell populations that can be identified using single-cell
sequencing technologies. The overarching goal of this proposal is to provide a deeper understanding of how
these aberrant cells communicate with their microenvironment and identify novel strategies for therapeutic
intervention. Our overarching hypothesis is that COPD heterogeneity is due to aberrant cell-cell and cell-matrix
communication that occur to varying degrees in susceptible individuals. In Aim 1, we will identify aberrant cell-
cell signaling by performing network level analyses of a newly created dataset of single-nuclear RNA sequencing
data generated with frozen lung tissue samples from the Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC). We will
then use spatial transcriptomics from the same samples to provide spatial context to these signaling pathways
and refine our understanding of aberrant cell-cell signaling in COPD. In Aim 2, we will assess cell-matrix
communication networks by performing proteomic profiling of decellularized lung tissue samples from the same
LTRC samples and perform network level analyses to assess cell-matrix interactions that are enriched in disease
or correlate with disease traits. By assessing spatial cell-cell interactions, and aberrant cell-matrix networks, we
hope to identify novel therapeutic targets for COPD.
This proposal is a response to the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) to support meritorious exploratory
research relevant to the NHLBI mission using the existing biospecimen collections that are stored in the NHLBI
Biologic Specimen Repository (Biorepository), thereby maximizing the scientific value of the stored collections,
and providing researchers with an opportunity to generate preliminary data for subsequent research proposals.

"PROJECT SUMMARY
Obesity is a global epidemic that is associated with sympathetic overactivation, endothelial dysfunction, and
insulin resistance; all of which can contribute to hypertension development. Despite well-established clinical
associations, the mechanisms connecting obesity with hypertension remain poorly understood, with several
antihypertensive therapies eliciting detrimental metabolic effects. This illustrates the need to identify new
targets with a positive metabolic profile for treatment of obesity hypertension. We propose that angiotensin-(1-
7), a protective hormone of the renin-angiotensin system, provides this ideal target. In support of this concept,
we have shown that acute and chronic angiotensin-(1-7) treatment reduces cardiovascular sympathetic tone
and blood pressure and improves endothelial function and insulin sensitivity in obese mouse models. There is
limited clinical data, however, with no information on systemic effects of angiotensin-(1-7) on cardiovascular or
metabolic outcomes in any patient population including obesity hypertension. To address this critical gap, we
obtained preliminary data in obese hypertensive subjects suggesting that: circulating angiotensin-(1-7) levels
are reduced and negatively correlate with blood pressure; acute intravenous angiotensin-(1-7) infusion reduces
blood pressure and may increase endothelial-dependent vasodilation and decrease sympathetic tone; and
angiotensin-(1-7) may improve insulin sensitivity, findings consistent with the positive metabolic effects seen in
animal models. Based on these data, this proposal will test the central hypothesis that angiotensin-(1-7)
improves cardiovascular and metabolic-related derangements in obesity hypertension. We propose proof-of-
concept mechanistic studies to examine the cardiovascular and metabolic effects of acute intravenous
angiotensin-(1-7) infusion in obese hypertensive subjects. We will test hypotheses that angiotensin-(1-7) can:
reduce sympathetic activity and blood pressure; improve endothelial function; and increase whole-body insulin
sensitivity and insulin-mediated microvascular recruitment. A sub-study will also be performed in pure
autonomic failure patients lacking autonomic modulation of blood pressure to determine if angiotensin-(1-7)
blood pressure and vasodilatory effects are via direct actions on the vasculature versus indirect engagement of
autonomic mechanisms. Any results obtained from these studies will be novel and will increase mechanistic
understanding of the role of angiotensin-(1-7) in the etiology of obesity hypertension.",Angiotensin-(1-7) and Cardiovascular Derangements in Obesity Hypertension,"PROJECT NARRATIVE

"ABSTRACT
Diabetes mellitus (DM) impairs cerebral waste clearance (CWC) and induces cerebral vascular dysfunction,
resulting in cognitive decline. The relationships between CWC and diabetic status have not been fully
investigated. Cerebral endothelial cells constitutively release exosomes, which mediate intercellular
communication. We have demonstrated that administration of exosomes isolated from cerebral endothelial cells
(CE-Exo) of healthy adult rats to DM rats improves cognitive function, minimizes DM-induced cerebral vascular
dysfunction and increases CWC. Waste clearance from the brain parenchyma has an important role in regulating
neurological diseases7, 15-22. We have found increased impairment of the CWC with severity of DM which highly
correlated to cognitive deficits in DM rats (Fig 2&3)12. Currently, studies of efflux pathways of the soluble β-
amyloid (Aβ) within the brain parenchyma have conflicting results between intramural periarterial drainage along
the opposite direction of arterial flow and glymphatic perivenous efflux7, 23, 24. The glymphatic, vascular and
meningeal lymphatic (ML) pathways are all involved in CWC3, 7, 20-22. We have demonstrated that highly sensitive
MRI methods using the superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) enhanced susceptibility weighted imaging (SPIO-
SWI) permit detection of cerebral microvessels and evaluation of CWC in glymphatic, vascular and ML pathways
(Fig 4-6)3, 25, 26. We also performed clinical translation of MRI measurements for CWC and found that the reduced
clearance rate from both the glymphatic and ML pathways was significantly associated with aging in patients14.
However, several critical issues related to clinical translation of CWC have not been resolved. Based on our
novel preliminary data, we posit that the SPIO-SWI technique permits analysis of the relative contributions of the
component vascular, glymphatic and ML systems to CWC, and thereby provides insight into their roles in
mediating cognitive dysfunction in the aged diabetic animal with and without therapeutic intervention. The
validation of MRI CWC measurements in current proposal could resolve the issues for clinical translation. To test
these hypotheses, we will first (Aim 1) investigate the effects of CE-Exo treatment on alterations of DM
associated CWC, vascular, molecular, and cognitive responses using MRI, fluorescent imaging, and immune-
histopathological analysis, and then (Aim 2) investigate the effects of CE-Exo treatment on the component
contributions of efflux pathways amount vascular, glymphatic and ML systems during waste clearance and their
relationships with vascular dysfunction and cognitive deficits in the aged DM animals with and without therapeutic
intervention.",Imaging cerebral waste clearance responses during exosome treatment of diabetes,"NARRATIVE

"Summary
The Administrative and Professional Development Core of this COBRE is designed to achieve two
complementary goals: 1) to build a critical mass of researchers who leverage large biomedical data sets to
study and improve the health of women, and 2) to foster cross-disciplinary collaborations, which we expect will
lead to significantly increased NIH-funding on our campus. The strategy for achieving these complementary
goals includes a multi-pronged approach to recruit talented new faculty, to engage existing faculty who either
have backgrounds in data science or in women’s health research, to provide training and support for cross-
disciplinary research, and to develop a strong cadre of research project leaders, who will receive extensive
support for their goals of becoming independent, NIH-funded investigators. The APD Core will be led by the
Center Director, Heather Desaire, who brings two decades of NIH-funded research and grant management
experience. The aims of the core are: (1) Hire three new tenure-track faculty. (2) Develop the Research-
Engaged Faculty Fellows (Pilot Project) Program. (3) Support five Research Project Leaders each year. (4)
Center Coordination, Semi-Annual Review, Strategic Planning. The successful completion of these aims will
markedly increase the biomedical research capabilities on our campus, establishing at our institution a unique
center that leverages data science for women’s health research. Additionally, the cross-disciplinary
collaborations will stimulate innovation, a necessary component for addressing longstanding barriers in

"Summary
 The Biomedical Data Sets and Services Core (BDSSC) of this COBRE will be established to expand
services and expertise provided beyond federal datasets to encompass all types of data utilized by the
Research Project Leaders (RPLs) who will be supported by this Phase 1 COBRE and future iterations. The
BDSSC’s primary innovation will be linking biomedical, environmental, and health records data to survey data
that collects demographic, marital status, family structure, education, and employment data to understand how
behavior, environment and biology combine to influence health outcomes. The BDSSC will achieve these
goals with the specific aims of: 1) assisting RPLs with data discovery and procurement for project
development; 2) building analysis datasets and providing statistical analysis for project execution; and 3)
expand core productivity to support COBRE stakeholders including RPLs, mentors, new faculty and other
biomedical and social science researchers. Building on the success of the BDSSC, researchers at KU and
across our region will have access to a new resource to support additional biomedical research funding in the
ever-advancing field of complex data science. As of now, no data services center exists at KU or in the region.

"Project Summary
Women experience neurological diseases like multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease at a higher
prevalence than men, and disease symptoms increase in severity after menopause. These connections
suggest that there is a fundamental link between estrogen regulation and brain health. Myelin damage is a
feature common to both neurological disease states, however, there are no FDA-approved therapies that
directly target myelin repair. The long-term goal of this project is to define how CNS lipids are regulated by
estrogen and how this affects neurological disease. The overall objective in this application is to determine how
estrogen regulates myelin and myelin lipid components during demyelination and remyelination. Preliminary
data presented in the application reveals that cholesterol ester metabolism has dynamic changes in response
to myelin damage. Work from other groups demonstrated that estrogen can regulate genes related to
cholesterol metabolism during demyelination and remyelination. These data form the basis for the central
hypothesis that estrogen signaling maintains myelin and promotes remyelination in part through regulation of
cholesterol synthesis and recycling. The central hypothesis will be evaluated by two specific aims: (1) Define
how estrogen signaling modulates myelin repair; (2) Map how estrogen signaling affects CNS cholesterol
metabolites during myelin damage and repair. The proposed research is innovative, in the applicant’s opinion,
because it tackles significant questions in women’s health at the intersection of hormone regulation and
neurological disease using an interdisciplinary approach. The proposal also features a novel mouse model of
myelin repair developed by the applicant that enables the proposed experiments, which would not be possible
with other animal models. Completion of the proposed research will reveal mechanistic insights into how
estrogen regulates cholesterol metabolism during CNS demyelination and remyelination. This contribution is
expected to be significant because it will reveal how estrogen controls CNS cholesterol during neurological
disease and may provide insight into why women experience cognitive decline during menopause and more

"Project Summary
There is an unmet need for innovative molecular tools that can assist in the clinical management of high-grade
serous ovarian cancer, given that more than 220,000 women in the U.S. are living with ovarian cancer and are
at risk of recurrence. Improving the performance of validated biomarkers by reinventing their detection strategy
is a compelling and underused approach to meet this need. The serum marker CA125 plays a crucial role in
the clinical management of ovarian cancer, but, despite its importance, it remains poorly understood. The iden-
tity and location of the CA125 epitopes—detected in the clinical test—are not known. In other words, the test
that underlies vital decisions in ovarian cancer care employs a mechanism that is not understood. Prior re-
search has located the CA125 epitopes somewhere within the tandem-repeat domain of a mucin (MUC16) that
contains 19 similar but non-identical subdomains. Glycan modifications, alternative splicing of mRNA, and pro-
teolytic cleavage generate many MUC16 proteoforms. Only a subset of these proteoforms contain detectable
CA125 epitopes, whereas, in others, the epitope is masked or eliminated. As a result, only a subset of the total
pool of MUC16 molecules is detectable by the serum CA125 assay. This undercounting has potentially serious
clinical implications, including mistaken decisions about whether a patient should be treated by a gynecologic
oncologist or failure to detect early evidence of possibly treatable cancer recurrence. Without knowledge of the
CA125 epitopes, it is impossible to characterize individual variation in MUC16 proteoforms or to determine
whether MUC16 expression changes during cancer development, in response to treatment, or during recur-
rence. Importantly, serum CA125 levels in Black women have been shown to be lower than levels in white
women, but the molecular-level reasons for these racial/ethnic differences in serum CA125 are unknown. The
tests and algorithms currently in use employ a single CA125 cut-off value and do not consider racial/ethnic dif-
ference, which may result in higher rates of false negative diagnoses among Black patients. To improve the
long-term survival of ovarian cancer patients of all backgrounds, there is a vital need to improve the diagnostic
value of CA125. The central hypothesis that will be tested is that CA125 epitopes are unevenly distributed over
tandem-repeat domains of MUC16, are unaffected by glycosylation, and display differences in abundance de-
pending on the cell type that expressed the MUC16. We will pursue two specific aims: (1) Map the locations
of OC125 and M11 binding on individual tandem repeats of MUC16, and (2) Characterize the binding of
OC125 and M11 to intact MUC16 from diverse sources. Successful completion of this research will identify
the CA125 epitopes on MUC16 at the amino-acid level. This accomplishment will represent an unprecedented
level of understanding of the CA125 test. This contribution will reveal regions of MUC16 that can be more ef-
fectively detected with novel affinity reagents or non-affinity-based approaches, such as mass spectrometry. It
may also contribute to explaining the origin of racial/ethnic differences in serum CA125 levels.",Clarifying the roles of glycoprotein sequence and cancer cell phenotype on the immunogenicity of ovarian cancer biomarker CA125,,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10770247,Affinity;Algorithms;Alternative Splicing;Amino Acids;Analytical Chemistry;Antibodies;Antibody Binding Sites;Big Data;Binding;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biology;CA-125 Antigen;Cancer Patient;Cell Line;Cells;Centers of Research Excellence;Chemicals;Cisplatin;Clinical;Clinical Management;Complex;Core Facility;Detection;Development;Diagnosis;Disease remission;Early Diagnosis;Epitopes;Exposure to;Failure;Funding;Glycoproteins;Goals;Gynecologic Oncologist;Immunoassay;Individual;Knowledge;Life Cycle Stages;Location;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of ovary;Maps;Masks;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Measures;Mentors;Messenger RNA;Modification;Molecular;Monitor;Mucins;Patients;Performance;Phenotype;Platinum;Play;Polysaccharides;Positioning Attribute;Protein Glycosylation;Proteins;Proteomics;Publishing;RNA Splicing;Race;Reagent;Recurrence;Recurrent Malignant Neoplasm;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Risk;Role;Screening for Ovarian Cancer;Serous;Serum;Serum Markers;Source;Spectrum Analysis;Surface Plasmon Resonance;System;Tandem Repeat Sequences;Tertiary Protein Structure;Testing;Tracer;United States National Institutes of Health;Variant;Woman;Women&apos;s Health;Work;analytical tool;aptamer;biomarker validation;black patient;black women;cancer biomarkers;cancer care;cancer cell;cancer recurrence;cell type;diagnostic value;ethnic difference;glycosylation;immunogenicity;improved;individual variation;innovation;invention;novel;ovarian neoplasm;programs;racial difference;research clinical testing;tool;treatment response;tumor,10770247,1P20GM152280-01,ovarian cancer,20,0.93,0.9,tru,,"project summary

"Project Summary
Many health promotion programs fail to address barriers to successful adoption of healthy behavior. Barriers
include lack of knowledge about individual risk and lack of motivation to prevent a disease decades in the
future. We propose to increase awareness of individual disease risk through disclosure of individual risks for
Alzheimer’s disease and to provide a program to prepare for adoption of health behavior change. Because
women in the U.S. have twice the lifetime risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and compelling evidence suggests
female-specific cardiometabolic and hormonal changes emerge in midlife that contribute to these sex
disparities, the behavioral intervention program is designed specifically for women in midlife. We hypothesize
that: 1) disclosure of individual risk information will increase awareness and motivation for health behavior
change, particularly among those at higher risk, 2) completing our intervention will increase awareness,
motivation, and action that precede health behavior change. Aim 1 is to evaluate whether the intervention
increases precursors to health behavior change. Using the electronic health record to identify participants
at risk for Alzheimer’s and baseline testing to quantify risk, we will inform participants of their individual
Alzheimer’s risk. We will randomize participants to start immediately (or after 12 weeks) the Women’s AD Risk
Reduction in Midlife (WARM) program. WARM is a 12 week online education and health coaching program,
followed by monthly group support and health coaching. Building on 10+ years of Alzheimer’s prevention
programs, WARM will focus on risks specifically elevated in midlife women. We will conduct a randomized
controlled trial to assess increased awareness, motivation, and action—precursors to adopting health behavior
change. Aim 2 is to Evaluate feasibility and acceptability of the Women’s AD Risk Reduction in Midlife
(WARM). We will assess feasibility in terms of 1) completion of educational modules, 2) scores on knowledge
assessments. We will assess acceptability via questionnaires (quality of materials, preferred delivery format
and frequency, coaching support, preferred timeline, level of commitment, and cost). We will conduct semi-
structured interviews with a sub-set of participants. Aim 3 is to Evaluate the effect of WARM on changes in
AD risk factors. At baseline and after week 12 we will assess changes in body composition, blood pressure,
and blood tests (fats and sugars), and self-reported health behaviors (diet, physical activity, sleep). The project
is innovative in its focus on midlife as the critical time to intervene, and disclosure of individual risk
information. The focus on successful adoption of health behaviors and the online delivery will enhance
successful implementation in later stages. It is innovative in its use of bioinformatics tools to identify a diverse
set of participants at increased Alzheimer’s risk.",Women's Alzheimer's Risk Reduction in Midlife,,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10770249,"Accounting;Address;Adherence;Adopted;Adoption;Alzheimer disease prevention;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Alzheimer&apos;s disease risk;American;Awareness;Behavior;Behavior Therapy;Big Data;Bioinformatics;Blood Pressure;Blood Tests;Body Composition;Body mass index;Brain;Career Mobility;Centers of Research Excellence;Clinical;Collaborations;Data;Data Set;Diagnosis;Diet;Disclosure;Disease;Disparity;E-learning;Education;Educational Intervention;Elderly;Electronic Health Record;Exercise;Fatty acid glycerol esters;Female;Frequencies;Future;Genetic;Goals;Grant;Health;Health Promotion;Health behavior;Health behavior change;High Density Lipoproteins;Hormonal;Hormonal Change;Individual;Intention;Intervention;Interview;Knowledge;LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins;Learning Module;Life Expectancy;Life Style;Lipids;Menopause;Mentorship;Modality;Modeling;Motivation;Movement;Participant;Patient Recruitments;Patient Self-Report;Physical activity;Positioning Attribute;Prevention program;Questionnaires;Randomized;Randomized, Controlled Trials;Research;Research Support;Resources;Risk;Risk Assessment;Risk Factors;Risk Reduction;Secure;Self Efficacy;Services;Sleep;Social support;Societies;Specialist;Stress;Structure;Support Groups;Symptoms;Testing;Time;Triglycerides;Waiting Lists;Woman;Women&apos;s Health;Writing;acceptability and feasibility;behavior change;bioinformatics tool;cardiometabolism;cost;design;diet and exercise;disorder risk;fasting glucose;health organization;high risk;improved;innovation;intervention program;lifestyle intervention;lifetime risk;middle age;multimodality;online delivery;prevent;programs;psychologic;recruit;risk perception;sex;sex disparity;skills;success;sugar;timeline;waist circumference",10770249,1P20GM152280-01,,,,,,,,"['accounting', 'address', 'adherence', 'adopted', 'adoption', 'alzheimer disease prevention', 'alzheimer&apos', 's disease', 'alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'american', 'awareness', 'behavior', 'behavior therapy', 'big data', 'bioinformatics', 'blood pressure', 'blood tests', 'body composition', 'body mass index', 'brain', 'career mobility', 'centers of research excellence', 'clinical', 'collaborations', 'data', 'data set', 'diagnosis', 'diet', 'disclosure', 'disease', 'disparity', 'e-learning', 'education', 'educational intervention', 'elderly', 'electronic health record', 'exercise', 'fatty acid glycerol esters', 'female', 'frequencies', 'future', 'genetic', 'goals', 'grant', 'health', 'health promotion', 'health behavior', 'health behavior change', 'high density lipoproteins', 'hormonal', 'hormonal change', 'individual', 'intention', 'intervention', 'interview', 'knowledge', 'ldl cholesterol lipoproteins', 'learning module', 'life expectancy', 'life style', 'lipids', 'menopause', 'mentorship', 'modality', 'modeling', 'motivation', 'movement', 'participant', 'patient recruitments', 'patient self-report', 'physical activity', 'positioning attribute', 'prevention program', 'questionnaires', 'randomized', 'randomized, controlled trials', 'research', 'research support', 'resources', 'risk', 'risk assessment', 'risk factors', 'risk reduction', 'secure', 'self efficacy', 'services', 'sleep', 'social support', 'societies', 'specialist', 'stress', 'structure', 'support groups', 'symptoms', 'testing', 'time', 'triglycerides', 'waiting lists', 'woman', 'women&apos', 's health', 'writing', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'behavior change', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cardiometabolism', 'cost', 'design', 'diet and exercise', 'disorder risk', 'fasting glucose', 'health organization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention program', 'lifestyle intervention', 'lifetime risk', 'middle age', 'multimodality', 'online delivery', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'recruit', 'risk perception', 'sex', 'sex disparity', 'skills', 'success', 'sugar', 'timeline', 'waist circumference']",,
"ABSTRACT
 Despite efforts to prevent suicide, US rates are climbing, and suicide is the second leading cause of death
amongst youth. While suicide safety planning interventions can be effective in reducing suicidal behavior,
adolescents often face challenges in sustaining their engagement with them. Studies have found that many
adolescents do not review their safety plans or attempt to use coping strategies following discharge. Digital
tools can provide a powerful means to enhance engagement with these interventions. The overall aim of this
SBIR Fast Track proposal is to enhance the effectiveness of safety planning amongst at risk youth by
developing and commercializing an augmented version of the BRITE smartphone app that provides enhanced
features that will optimize effectiveness by addressing known barriers to user engagement. The BRITE app
facilitates self-efficacy by encouraging self-monitoring of emotional distress and utilization of effective coping
strategies as well as providing ready access to a safety plan on the adolescent’s smartphone. The BRITE app
was developed on evidence-based principles and has undergone rigorous formative development and
effectiveness evaluations. However, to optimize its functionality, commercial viability, and scale its
implementation, issues related to user engagement need to be addressed. Recent developments in Ecological
Momentary Assessment (EMA) and mobile sensing (MS) can provide useful triggers to automatically “push”
pertinent safety planning information to individuals during periods of higher risk, which will allow the integration
of just-in-time adaptive intervention features within BRITE and should result in more sustained engagement
with the plan and increased effectiveness. In Phase I we will develop an augmented version of the BRITE app
(BRITE 2.0) that integrates just-in-time automated push notifications for consistent practice of coping skills and
for safety planning resources during periods of escalating risk, and will evaluate the usability and acceptability
of this product with practitioners and end users. The aim of Phase II is to conduct a micro randomized trial to
optimize treatment components, and to conduct an initial RCT to evaluate whether these enhancements
increase user engagement.",BRITE 2.0: A just-in-time adaptive intervention for suicide safety planning in adolescents,"PROJECT NARRATIVE

"Overweight and obesity are public health problems and contribute to numerous chronic diseases. Most
Behavioral Weight Loss Interventions (BWI) have typically included aerobic forms of exercise (e.g., brisk walking)
and have shown that this form of physical activity enhances weight loss compared to dietary approaches alone.
Given the potential benefits of yoga, there are claims that these benefits can contribute to yoga being effective
for weight loss. However, there are few long-term rigorous studies of yoga to support that yoga can enhance
weight loss, or other health outcomes, beyond what is achieved with other forms of physical activity within the
context of a BWI for adults with overweigh or obesity. The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee
found that there was insufficient evidence available to determine the relationship between yoga on indicators of
health risk progression, which included body mass index (BMI). Therefore, the Physical Activity Guidelines
Advisory Committee recommended the need to conduct systematic and coordinated randomized trials on the
health effects of yoga, and we will be focused on obesity in this application.
 We propose a study of high scientific rigor using a randomized clinical trial design in this current application.
This study will build on our preliminary work and will conduct a 12-month randomized clinical trial. We will
implement a BWI and randomize participants to one of two physical activity prescriptions: 1) aerobic physical
activity (BWI+AER), 2) aerobic + yoga physical activity (BWI+AER+YOGA). The BWI includes contemporary
evidence-based behavioral strategies and a proven energy-reduced diet. The primary outcome will be weight
loss. Additional outcomes will include physical activity (moderate-to-vigorous intensity, light-intensity,
engagement in yoga), body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength, resting blood pressure,
process measures of diet and eating behavior. We also will assess the acute and chronic effects on measures
that may be particularly responsive to yoga that may also influence weight loss. These include perceived stress
and distress, affect/mood, depressive symptoms, sleep, and hunger/satiety. We will examine moderators (e.g.,
sex, race/ethnicity, etc.) of the effectiveness of our interventions on weight change and other outcomes.
 This study is important to patients with overweight and obesity, and clinicians who treat these patients. This
will provide clarity on the contribution of yoga to weight loss and other health outcomes in patients with obesity,
which is based on rigorous science within the context of a randomized trial.",Effectiveness of the Addition of Yoga to a Behavioral Weight Loss Intervention for Adults with Overweight or Obesity,"It is important to develop and implement more effective interventions for improving long-term weight loss.
There is some evidence that mind-body interventions, specifically yoga, have the potential to contribute to
improved weight loss; however, these interventions have not been extensively studied within the context of a
comprehensive behavioral weight loss intervention. This study proposes to implement a novel intervention that
combines yoga with a behavioral weight loss intervention to examine its effectiveness on potentially enhancing
weight loss and other health outcomes in adults with overweight or obesity.",https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10801397,"Acute;Adult;Advisory Committees;Aerobic;Affect;Behavioral;Blood Pressure;Body Composition;Body Weight Changes;Body Weight decreased;Body mass index;Chronic;Chronic Disease;Clinical Trials Design;Data;Diet;Distress;Eating;Eating Behavior;Effectiveness;Eligibility Determination;Energy Metabolism;Ethnic Origin;Exercise;Focus Groups;Guidelines;Health;Health Benefit;Hunger;Intervention;Measures;Mental Depression;Mental Health;Methodology;Mind-Body Intervention;Moods;Muscle;Obesity;Outcome;Overweight;Participant;Patients;Pattern;Physical activity;Pilot Projects;Process Measure;Public Health;Race;Randomized;Recommendation;Reducing diet;Reporting;Research;Research Design;Rest;Safety;Satiation;Science;Sleep;Stress;Walking;Work;Yoga;adult obesity;cardiorespiratory fitness;depressive symptoms;dietary approach;effective intervention;evidence base;fitness;high standard;improved;light intensity;mindfulness;moderate-to-vigorous physical activity;novel;obese patients;perceived stress;primary outcome;progression risk;psychologic;randomized trial;randomized, clinical trials;response;secondary outcome;sedentary lifestyle;sex;systematic review;trial design;vigorous intensity;weight loss intervention",10801397,1R01DK135735-01A1,,,,,,,,"['acute', 'adult', 'advisory committees', 'aerobic', 'affect', 'behavioral', 'blood pressure', 'body composition', 'body weight changes', 'body weight decreased', 'body mass index', 'chronic', 'chronic disease', 'clinical trials design', 'data', 'diet', 'distress', 'eating', 'eating behavior', 'effectiveness', 'eligibility determination', 'energy metabolism', 'ethnic origin', 'exercise', 'focus groups', 'guidelines', 'health', 'health benefit', 'hunger', 'intervention', 'measures', 'mental depression', 'mental health', 'methodology', 'mind-body intervention', 'moods', 'muscle', 'obesity', 'outcome', 'overweight', 'participant', 'patients', 'pattern', 'physical activity', 'pilot projects', 'process measure', 'public health', 'race', 'randomized', 'recommendation', 'reducing diet', 'reporting', 'research', 'research design', 'rest', 'safety', 'satiation', 'science', 'sleep', 'stress', 'walking', 'work', 'yoga', 'adult obesity', 'cardiorespiratory fitness', 'depressive symptoms', 'dietary approach', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'fitness', 'high standard', 'improved', 'light intensity', 'mindfulness', 'moderate-to-vigorous physical activity', 'novel', 'obese patients', 'perceived stress', 'primary outcome', 'progression risk', 'psychologic', 'randomized trial', 'randomized, clinical trials', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sex', 'systematic review', 'trial design', 'vigorous intensity', 'weight loss intervention']",,
"This request is for funds to purchase a JEOL JSM-IT700HRLA Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) with
EDS. The instrument will be housed within the Center for Biologic Imaging (CBI) a large, centralized imaging facility
serving the needs of NIH supported researchers across our campus and at other local institutions. The mandate of
this core facility is to provide access to and training for a full range of light and electron microscopy platforms, image
analysis, and morphometric technologies to research groups within the school of medicine and elsewhere across
campus.
 SEM is an essential service provided by the center. The current microscope within the facility is a 22-year-
old JEOL 6335F SEM. This microscope has been in constant service since it was purchased in 2001, using funds
provided by the S10 mechanism (1S10RR015738-01). During its life cycle it has been used between 1000-2000
hours each year for NIH supported research and has been kept under service contract throughout this entire time.
 The primary reason for submitting this proposal is to replace this microscope because the manufacturer
(JEOL) will no longer support or service the system (letter included) due to a lack of available parts or expertise in
the field service team to service the device. All service support will end in April 2024.
 A second reason for this application for a new instrument is to improve and expand the SEM capabilities of
the core to meet the needs of our current NIH funded biomedical researchers. SEM technology has advanced
significantly over what was available 22 years ago, and the current system lacks the resolution, speed, and sensitivity
of a current instrument partly because of technologic advances but also general decreases in performance due to
age (even with continuous maintenance). To put this in context, the system was originally supplied with a polaroid
camera back, and the most recent update possible for the computer system (from Windows XP to Windows 7) was
a decade ago.
 Finally, as is described throughout the proposal, the analytic capabilities of SEM (using EDS) are completely
absent from our current system. We have a significant and growing group of NIH funded users who have truly
fundamental needs for this analytic functionality and have made a compelling case to bring this technology to the
center.
 Together we feel that these reasons present a very strong and compelling case to replace and upgrade our
current SEM with a contemporary device.",JEOL JSM-IT700HRLA Scanning Electron Microscope,"The Scanning electron microscope (SEM) is an essential tool to study tissue structure and
local elemental components in tissues and cells. The SEM available within the CBI is over

(EDS) by our NIH funded user population is driving this request to place a contemporary
high quality SEM in the Center for Biologic Imaging to allow practical application of SEM

"The goal of this research education program ─ Inspiring Undergraduate Student Training in Alzheimer's
Research (USTAR) ─ is to provide Black/African American (B/AA) undergraduate students with mentored
didactic, clinical, and research experiences to stimulate interest in pursuing research careers related to
Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). USTAR specifically focuses on social determinants of
health as risk factors for ADRD in B/AAs. USTAR's scientific rationale is that B/AA undergraduates are less
likely that White undergraduates to enter the biomedical workforce. This disparity is important because B/AAs
are disproportionally affected by ADRD, and B/AA scientists may more deeply appreciate the sociocultural
forces that create racial health disparities. USTAR brings together the research training skills of faculty at
Thomas Jefferson University (TJU) and Delaware State University (DSU), a Historically Black College and
University (HBCU). USTAR's multi-PI leaders include an ADRD clinical researcher (Rovner; TJU), a B/AA
ADRD neuroscientist (Lawal; DSU), and a geriatrician who focuses on ADRD (Parks; TJU). Our combined
expertise in ADRD research and clinical care, social determinants of health, neuroscience, neuroimaging, and
interprofessional care in geriatrics, and our experience recruiting and mentoring B/AA undergraduates, guide
this exciting new learning opportunity. The 20-month USTAR program will train two cohorts of ten rising junior
B/AA undergraduates. Each USTAR trainee will have an Academic Mentor who advises on academic progress
and career planning, and a Research Mentor who advises on research training. Trainees may seek optional
mentorship from a B/AA faculty mentor if a trainee wishes to have a race-congruent mentoring experience. The
USTAR program is comprised of: 1) two 8-week summer sessions (i.e., one session prior to both the junior and
senior undergraduate years) that include didactic, research, clinical, and community-based learning
experiences; 2) educational and research activities during the junior and senior academic years; and 3) a
model longitudinal observational study of a racially diverse sample of older adults with normal cognition, mild
cognitive impairment, and ADRD. Across all activities, we will emphasize the relationship between social
determinants of health and cognition. Collaborating faculty include 17 clinicians and researchers with
complementary expertise. The Specific Aims of USTAR are to: 1) Provide interdisciplinary ADRD-related
research, educational, clinical, and community experiences; 2) Enhance trainee research skills via independent
research projects; 3) Facilitate B/AA student transition from undergraduate to graduate studies in science; and
4) Evaluate USTAR's effectiveness. USTAR has potential to increase diversity in the national workforce that
conducts health disparities research pertaining to ADRD. This goal aligns with the NIA mission to meet the

"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
We have developed the program, Pipeline for Aging Research Career Training (PACT). The project is a
research education and mentoring program featuring students and faculty from an urban University in
Washington, DC, three regional undergraduate Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), and a respected and
experienced laboratory training center. A team of MSTEM faculty from Georgetown, North Carolina Central
and Hampton Universities will train and mentor underserved students in aging research topics including health
equity. The program will be enhanced by mentoring and educational activities that include presentations from
experts in Aging Science in the Washington, D.C. area
Awareness, confidence, and mentored lab research training provide students the tools to graduate college with
a science degree and pursue graduate studies in biomedical science. Training programs can be transformative
experiences that introduce students to a new vocabulary of scientific terms, concepts and career development
strategies. The PACT program we propose is designed to provide those key experiences. The goal of the NIA
R25 program is to “encourage individuals from diverse backgrounds to pursue further studies or careers in
biomedical research.” The program proposed is creatively designed to support that goal.
The impact of this program will be the successful training and mentoring of 15 undergraduate students each
year. The trainees will gain facility in research practice and techniques by participating in an intensive
residential 6-day summer laboratory training course at the Georgetown University BioScience training labs.
Lectures and laboratories are designed to highlight aging science topics and use of cell types and reagent kits
and techniques relevant in aging research. Undergraduate trainees will be matched with mentors and train in a
laboratory for an additional 8 weeks in the summer and the academic year. Structured mentoring and career
development activities will continue to be provided with a focus on discovery of career choices in aging
disciplines.
In leveraging the central Washington D.C site, an annual Aging Research forum will be hosted on the GU
campus for trainees and mentors. Research project findings will be presented by summer trainees. The forum
will feature a panel of NIH and Aging experts who will present on topics in Geroscience and Health Equity and
aging career trends and introduce students to further opportunities for training. The PACT program plan will
enhance underserved student participation in bioscience research and provide confidence and exposure to
continue on with a career in aging.",Pipeline in Aging Research Career Training (PACT),"Project Narrative

"Project Summary/Abstract:
In the United States, over 10,000 new diagnoses of the pediatric lung disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia
(BPD), are made annually in surviving premature infants, with costs exceeding $2.5 billion. Treatment options,
such as adrenergic receptor agonists, have variable efficacy for the obstructive airway manifestations that
characterize this disease. Furthermore, these patients have an elevated risk of mortality and early onset chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease. In a neonatal hyperoxia mouse model of BPD and airway hyperreactivity, the
PI’s new data identify a viable therapy for this oxidant-related disease. Treatment with S-nitrosoglutathione
(GSNO) reverses airways hyperresponsiveness in oxygen exposed juvenile mice and room air recovered adults.
GSNO is a potent endogenous bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory, critical for the airways diseases of asthma
and cystic fibrosis. In this model, hyperoxia increases the catabolic breakdown of GSNO caused by increased
expression and activity of the enzyme, S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), in-part through hyperoxic
downregulation of a microRNA (miR-342). Furthermore, mice that do not express the GSNOR gene are protected
from hyperoxia induced alveolar simplification, airway hyperreactivity, and end-organ pulmonary hypertensive
changes. This proposal will test the overall hypotheses that (1) molecular GSNOR catabolism of beneficial GSNO
in relevant cells drives the development of BPD and (2) genetic or pharmacologic targeting of the GSNO/GSNOR
pathway will mitigate inflammation and disease. This proposal will evaluate the effects of neonatal hyperoxia in
genetic GSNOR knock-outs by investigating the molecular mechanisms in which GSNO confers protection,
distinguish gene expression profiles at a single-nucleus level in lung tissue from wild type and GSNOR knock-
outs, elucidate the roles of GSNOR in alveolar & airway epithelial cells or myeloid immune cells using Cre/loxP
cell-specific knock-outs, and test pharmacologic GSNOR inhibition or exogenous inhaled GSNO during
hyperoxia. These studies are clinically important because inhaled GSNO and GSNOR inhibitors are being
studied for airway diseases such as asthma and cystic fibrosis which could ultimately serve as viable new
therapies for BPD.",S-Nitrosoglutathione therapy for oxidant disease of the neonatal airways and lung,"Project Narrative:

"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR) is a prevalent, yet underappreciated and underdiagnosed condition
that gives rise to a particularly lethal form of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). An unusual
aspect of ATTR is its strong male bias (94% male in wild-type ATTR and 72% in mutant ATTR). We hypothesize
that the mosaic loss of the Y chromosome (mLOY) in the hematopoietic system plays a role in the etiology of
ATTR. mLOY is the most prevalent postzygotic mutation in males. mLOY describes the clonal loss of the Y
chromosome in cells that frequently arises in the hematopoietic system. Recent work by the Walsh lab has
associated mLOY with incident cardiovascular disease in humans and demonstrated that experimental LOY in
the hematopoietic system can lead to spontaneous heart failure in mice (Sano et al. Science 2022). More
recently, we have found association between mLOY and TTR cardiac amyloidosis in the patient population,
providing a compelling rationale for the strong sex bias that is common to this condition. Thus, the causal and
mechanistic relationships between mLOY and cardiac amyloidosis will be explored.",Mosaic Loss of the Y Chromosome in Cardiac Amyloidosis,"NARRATIVE

"PROJECT SUMMARY
A comprehensive understanding of immunity necessitates a thorough exploration of the intricate interactions
between immune cells and neurotransmitters, thereby clarifying their impact on communication at the neuron-
immune synapse. The long-term goal of my research program is to develop new electrochemical and microfluidic
tools to study dynamic neuroimmune communication to understand the molecular mechanisms of
neuroinflammation. To achieve this goal, new approaches are needed which can measure immune cell
communication with higher temporal resolution. The specific objective of this proposal is to demonstrate and
determine the mechanism of subsecond dopamine signaling from CD4+ CD25+ T-cells (Tregs) and to establish
how dopamine release from senescent Tregs impacts neuronal health. Tregs are important immune cells that
function to suppress the immune system and have been implicated in several age-associated neurodegenerative
diseases. Tregs contain the machinery to synthesize and respond to dopamine; however, to date, direct real-time
measurements of dopamine release and how this subsecond signaling influences neuron-immune crosstalk has
not been possible. Current paradigms hold that immune cell secretion of neurotransmitters does not occur with
subsecond dynamics seen in neurons and is therefore dispensable in neuronal biology. The evidence supporting
this viewpoint is limited by the lack of experimental systems to measure physiological secretion of neurotransmitters
by immune cells on this timescale. Our unprecedented preliminary studies using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry
(FSCV) reveals that T cells are capable of rapid subsecond secretion of dopamine. This proposal is based on the
premise that employing traditional neuroscience methods to investigate neurochemical signaling in isolated
immune cells can yield valuable insights into the dynamic mechanisms of subsecond immune cell communication
during aging. The proposal will be completed by the following two specific aims: (1) Ascertain the mechanism of
subsecond dopamine release from Tregs and (2) Develop a neuron-Treg co-culture platform to probe the
consequence of subsecond Treg-derived dopamine signaling on neuronal health with age. We will pursue these
aims with an innovative approach combining the power of FSCV’s subsecond detection capabilities with traditional
immunology approaches in co-cultures of Tregs and cholinergic neurons. This work is significant because we will
reveal the ability of Tregs to release dopamine on a subsecond timescale and demonstrate that this rapid immune-
derived neurochemical signaling influences neuronal health for the first time. The expected outcome is a new
understanding of the dynamics of immune cell signaling and a deeper understanding of the molecular changes
which occur at the neuron-immune cell synapse as a function of age. This work will have a positive impact on how
we study immune cell signaling, and will advance current knowledge of how neurochemicals help regulate immunity
leading to advancements in targeted immunotherapies for neurodegenerative diseases.",Untangling the role of dopamine release from Tregs: implications for neurodegeneration at the neuron-immune synapse,"PROJECT NARATIVE
The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the dynamics and
mechanism of how regulatory T cells use dopamine to control their function is informative for
understanding a variety of immune-related disorders and even neurodegeneration.
Understanding how immune cell-derived dopamine changes with age and how these changes
influence signaling at neuron-immune synapses is not well understood and this proposal seeks
to address this fundamental gap. Thus, this proposal is relevant to part of the NIH’s mission that

"Project Summary (Abstract)
 This R34 will develop and test an adjunctive treatment protocol for addressing co-occurring
internalizing disorders among adolescents (age 13-21) enrolled in usual care for substance use
problems. Internalizing disorders (IDs), primarily depression and anxiety, are highly prevalent
among youth receiving community-based treatment for substance use disorders (SUDs), and
unresolved ID issues significantly interfere with SUD treatment and recovery processes. Yet, the
youth SUD clinical workforce is not systematically educated or trained in evidence-based
practices for ID; thus, line services for youth SUD do not systematically target IDs. The research
literature offers a few integrated behavioral models for simultaneously treating both SUDs and
IDs in youth; however, such models feature intensive manualized procedures that have proven
cumbersome to scale and deliver in frontline settings. As a result, the clinical workforce, though
desiring ID-focused training, currently has inadequate resources for treating IDs effectively. A
promising solution to reduce this quality gap is developing a modular, family-based protocol to
augment routine care for comorbid SUD/ID by directly targeting ID as a primary treatment goal:
Family Support Protocol for Adolescent Internalizing Disorders (Fam-AID). Fam-AID will contain
six modules designed to enhance existing SUD services and to be delivered in any sequence to
meet client needs: (1) Family Engagement of caregivers in treatment planning and services; (2)
Relational Reframing of family constraints, resiliencies, and social capital connected to the
youth's ID symptoms; (3) Functional Analysis of the youth's ID symptoms and related behaviors;
(4) Core cognitive-behavioral treatment techniques to address the youth's ID symptoms and
functional needs, featuring transdiagnostic interventions (emotion acceptance, emotional
exposure, behavioral activation) to address negative affect and emotional dysregulation
underlying both depression and anxiety; (5) Family Psychoeducation and Safety Planning
focused on education about comorbid SUD/ID and prevention of youth self-harm.
 The study will follow the NIDA blueprint for Stage 1 development of behavioral protocols. In
the Pilot Stage we will use rapid cycle prototyping methods in collaboration with end-user
stakeholders at two Pilot sites to: (1) Draft protocol delivery and fidelity guidelines adapted from
existing study team resources; (2) Solicit clinic staff and client input on protocol content and
delivery via cognitive interviewing; (3) Pilot the prototype components on 2-3 cases at each site.
We will then conduct an Interrupted Time Series Study for N = 60 comorbid SUD/ID cases
across two sites serving diverse youth: 30 will receive TAU (historical control), and then
following line staff training in the protocol, 30 new cases will receive TAU enhanced by Fam-
AID. Aim 1 will examine Fam-AID cases for protocol acceptability via therapist and client
interviews and fidelity benchmarks via therapist- and observer-report protocol fidelity data. Aim
2 will compare Fam-AID versus TAU for immediate outcomes on family attendance in sessions
and ultimate outcomes on youth ID symptoms at Baseline, 3-, and 6-month follow-up.",Testing the Feasibility of a Family-based Adjunctive Treatment Protocol for Targeting Co-Occurring Internalizing Disorders among Adolescents with SUD,"Project Narrative

"Summary:
∆8-THC is a minor cannabinoid found in the cannabis plant, possibly as an artifact
resulting from non-enzymatic isomerization of a small amount of ∆9-THC. Outside of the
plant, ∆8-THC can be easily synthesized from CBD. As a result of federal and state
policy changes, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, and the absence of clear
guidance on the control status of ∆8-THC, manufacturers have produced large supplies
of this cannabinoid, which is now available to the public everywhere unregulated, in
spite of clear warning from the CDC and FDA to the possible risks of consuming ∆8-THC
containing products.
The synthetic process of converting hemp-derived CBD to ∆8-THC results in several
impurities in the marketed products. Our group has identified 15 impurities, eight of
them with no known pharmacological properties. The goal of this proposal is directed
toward the isolation and characterization of these impurities in sufficient supply to study
their pharmacology and their interaction with ∆8-THC. This will be achieved through the
following set of specific aims:
Aim 1: To scale up the isolation process for ∆8-THC products' impurities to prepare
enough supply for both in vitro and in vivo evaluation.
Aim 2: To assess the affinity, potency, and behavioral effects of ∆8-THC products'
impurities. This will be carried out using in vitro assays to study the binding affinity of
each impurity to human CB1, CB2, and GPR55 receptors. Efficacy and potency will be
evaluated using functional GTPγS and/or cAMP assays as well as calcium mobilization
assays in cultured neurons.
Further, in vivo testing of impurities' effects on body temperature, locomotion, catalepsy
and nociception will be evaluated in cohorts of male and female mice (tetrad assay).
Aim 3: To determine whether ∆8-THC impurities can potentiate, antagonize, or be
additive to the psychoactive effects of ∆8-THC through both in vitro and in vivo studies.
Our team has the necessary expertise to achieve these goals. At the conclusion of this
work, we will have a good understanding of the pharmacology of these impurities and
how they influence the effects of ∆8-THC.",Isolation and Pharmacological Evaluation of Impurities in Δ-8-THC Products,"Narrative:
Commercially marketed ∆8-THC products were found to have several contaminants
(impurities) resulting from the chemical conversion of hemp-derived CBD to ∆8-THC.
This project is directed towards the isolation and purification of those impurities in

and in vivo studies will be carried out on each impurity to delineate their individual
effects as well as their effects on ∆8-THC activity.",https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10869733,Acids;Address;Adverse event;Affinity;Agonist;Agriculture;Behavioral;Binding;Biological;Biological Assay;Body Temperature;CNR1 gene;CNR2 gene;Cannabinoids;Cannabis;Catalepsy;Chemicals;Consumption;Cyclic AMP;Cyclization;Dose;Evaluation;Female;GPR55 receptor;Goals;Hemp;Human;In Vitro;Individual;Isomerism;Left;Locomotion;Manufacturer;Marketing;Measures;Minor;Morphologic artifacts;Motor Activity;Mus;Neurons;Nociception;Pharmacodynamics;Pharmacology;Plants;Policies;Procedures;Process;Production;Property;Protocols documentation;Public Health;Publishing;Regulation;Reporting;Risk;Rodent;Safety;Sampling;Signal Transduction;Testing;Tetrahydrocannabinol;Work;antagonist;antinociception;cannabinoid receptor;cohort;comparative efficacy;efficacy evaluation;improved;in vitro Assay;in vivo;in vivo evaluation;insight;male;manufacture;natural hypothermia;novel;pharmacologic;release of sequestered calcium ion into cytoplasm;research clinical testing;response;scale up;synergism,10869733,1R21DA060394-01,,,,,,,,"['acids', 'address', 'adverse event', 'affinity', 'agonist', 'agriculture', 'behavioral', 'binding', 'biological', 'biological assay', 'body temperature', 'cnr1 gene', 'cnr2 gene', 'cannabinoids', 'cannabis', 'catalepsy', 'chemicals', 'consumption', 'cyclic amp', 'cyclization', 'dose', 'evaluation', 'female', 'gpr55 receptor', 'goals', 'hemp', 'human', 'in vitro', 'individual', 'isomerism', 'left', 'locomotion', 'manufacturer', 'marketing', 'measures', 'minor', 'morphologic artifacts', 'motor activity', 'mus', 'neurons', 'nociception', 'pharmacodynamics', 'pharmacology', 'plants', 'policies', 'procedures', 'process', 'production', 'property', 'protocols documentation', 'public health', 'publishing', 'regulation', 'reporting', 'risk', 'rodent', 'safety', 'sampling', 'signal transduction', 'testing', 'tetrahydrocannabinol', 'work', 'antagonist', 'antinociception', 'cannabinoid receptor', 'cohort', 'comparative efficacy', 'efficacy evaluation', 'improved', 'in vitro assay', 'in vivo', 'in vivo evaluation', 'insight', 'male', 'manufacture', 'natural hypothermia', 'novel', 'pharmacologic', 'release of sequestered calcium ion into cytoplasm', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'scale up', 'synergism']",,
"The survival of neuronal cells critically depends on the correct function of their lysosomes, catabolic organelles
that play key roles in disposing damaged and harmful cellular components. Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) is a
neurodegenerative and metabolic disease triggered by mutations of the NPC1 gene, which encodes a lysosomal
membrane protein involved in the trafficking and partitioning of cholesterol. In cells lacking NPC1, cholesterol
accumulates aberrantly inside the lysosome, triggering a cascade of downstream events that impact
mitochondria, ultimately leading to cellular dysfunction and death. Understanding how the molecular details of
the primary lysosomal dysfunction, and the downstream processes that impact mitochondrial homeostasis and
overall cell metabolism is key to the design of more effective and targeted strategies to restore neuronal cell
homeostasis in NPC. Recently, the PI (RZ) and co-Investigator (PO) laboratories have made foundational
discoveries that deepened the current understanding of NPC pathogenesis. In particular, through organelle
immunoisolation and profiling we uncovered a profound impairment in lysosomal proteolysis, hydrolase content
and membrane stability, coupled with defective delivery of damaged mitochondria to the lysosome during
autophagy. Additionally, through initial studies in iPSC-derived patient-specific and NPC1-deleted neurons, we
uncovered a direct connection between alterations of lysosomal function, mitochondrial metabolism and neuronal
failure. Finally, we established that mTORC1, a nutrient-sensing pathway based at the lysosome, becomes
dysregulated in NPC, and that its pharmacological manipulation corrects multiple organelle defects. Combined,
these findings provide a rich and detailed understanding of molecular aspects of NPC pathology. Specifically,
they lead us to hypothesize that the lysosomal cholesterol-mTORC1 pathway we discovered drives loss of
neuronal cell homeostasis and may be a therapeutic target in NPC. In order to effectively target the cholesterol-
mTORC1 axis for neuronal resilience and NPC therapy, we propose to i) mechanistically and structurally
elucidate the molecular mechanisms connecting cholesterol levels to mTORC1 regulation, ii) determine how
selectively disabling the cholesterol-mTORC1 sensing pathway impacts mitochondrial metabolism and neuronal
survival in NPC disease models iii) discover new pathways that control organelle function and cellular
metabolism, and evaluate their role as candidate NPC disease modifiers. To accomplish these goals, we will
combine biochemical, cellular and unbiased approaches, including functional genomics and metabolomics in
both neuronal and non-neuronal models of NPC disease. We will rigorously prioritize and validate the most
promising targets, and elucidate their role within the framework of organelle function and neuronal cell
homeostasis. This proposal will deepen our understanding of NPC drivers and disease modifiers, with relevance
to neurodegenerative conditions linked to cholesterol imbalance, such as Alzheimer Disease.",Deciphering and disabling lysosome-dependent mechanisms of neurodegeneration,"Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) is a rare neurodegenerative and metabolic disease triggered by aberrant trafficking

"Acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) are the leading cause of death in children under 5 years old. There is
a high prevalence of pediatric ALRI-related hypoxemia in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Building
on past successes, this proposal aims to advance the use of pulse oximetry in LMICs. In Malawi a SpO2
(peripheral oxygen saturation) of 90-92% was associated with child ALRI mortality which is consistent with a
retrospective study from the United States that reported SpO2 may over-estimate arterial oxygen saturation
(SaO2) by 4.3% in Black children. Pulse oximeters are not universally available in outpatient settings in LMICs
due to a lack of health system financing. Government stakeholders often must prioritize low, or perceived, low
cost high output interventions. However, the cost of pulse oximetry implementation in these settings remains
unknown. For outpatient pulse oximeters to reduce child ALRI mortality, they must accurately and reliably
measure SpO2 and be financially and time cost effective.
The aims of this mixed methods study are to 1) examine the accuracy of SpO2 in children with dark and fair skin
tones and 2) compare the costs of ambulatory reflectance versus transmissive pulse oximetry implementation
for outpatient child ALRI care in South Africa. These aims address the NHLBI's mission to lead the world in
advancing translational research that bridges the gap between clinical research to practice and population to
health outcome.
Interventions to improve early identification of hypoxemic children and provision of appropriate care are critical
to reduce child ALRI mortality. This proposal leverages the unexplored roles of cost analysis and compares
objective findings with clinician perceptions of time-costs in pulse oximetry use and generates critical racial health
disparity-related data to inform future studies aimed at improving equitable care and treatment by refining SpO2
interpretation.

"PROJECT SUMMARY
Excessive cell death contributes to tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease (AD), which are pathologically
characterized by the aberrant accumulation of the microtubule associated protein tau and its oligomerization into
neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). To identify therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative tauopathies such as
Alzheimer's disease, it is vital to elucidate molecular mechanisms controlling cellular response to proteotoxic
stress due to tau accumulation. We have examined how BCL-2 family member BOK, which chiefly appears
bound to the inositol-3-phosphate (IP3R) calcium transporter in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), induces
apoptosis in response to select ER stress stimuli. We found BOK mediates calcium transfer from ER to
mitochondria and is key to forming mitochondrial-ER contact sites (MERCs), also called mitochondrial ER-
associated membranes (MAMs). MAMs are central signaling hubs, mediating cell processes like calcium transfer
and metabolic homeostasis; many are regulated by BOK. Our objective is to directly address how BOK regulates
tau-induced cell death in neurons through specific MAM subsets, including the ion-MAM, which mediates calcium
transfer, and the phago-MAM, which is where autophagosomes are produced. Aim 1 will determine the role of
BOK in ion-MAM regulation of tauopathy by examining calcium levels and cell death in BOK deficient cortical
neurons challenged by mutant tau-induced ER stress. Aim 2 will determine the role of BOK in phago-MAM
regulation of tauopathy by analyzing the impact of BOK and MAM formation on autophagy in neurons challenged
by mutant tau. Aim 3 will determine the physiological consequences of loss of BOK on tauopathy-induced
neurodegeneration. This project is conceptually innovative in our recognition that BOK regulates MAMs, which
are altered in patients diagnosed with dementia. The project is technically innovative in our use of 2Phatal, two-
photon chemical apoptotic targeted ablation, to study cell death in tauopathies. This technique uses a
femtosecond-pulsed laser to induce dose-dependent apoptosis of individual cells in mouse brains in vivo without
collateral damage. Our hypothesis is that BOK's ability to impact ER-stress induced apoptosis, calcium
regulation, and MAM formation suggests a critical but undefined role in the production of autophagic membranes
and the regulation of neuronal cell death in tauopathy-induced neurodegeneration. This project will elucidate the
metabolic pathways regulated by BOK to reveal potential mechanisms to prevent tau-mediated death of neurons,
providing targets for therapeutic development. This proposal is submitted in response to PAR-23-179, Small
Research Grant Program for the Next Generation of Researchers in AD/ADRD Research (R03 Clinical Trial
Optional). The proposed project leverages the Principal Investigator's prior discoveries and expertise on the
multi-domain, pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family member BOK to examine a novel role in autophagy failure and cell
death as it relates to AD and other tauopathies.",Contribution of Mitochondrial Associated Membrane (MAM) Signaling to Neurodegeneration,"PROJECT NARRATIVE

"PROJECT SUMMARY
Human papillomavirus (HPV)-driven oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPSCC) has been rising in incidence
in the US and worldwide over the last four decades, particularly among young men. People with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have an increased HPV-OPSCC risk as compared to HIV-negative individuals.
However, we have a very poor understanding of the mechanisms of persistent oral HPV infections and their
synergy with HIV co-infection, as well as the role of HIV in HPV-OPSCC induction and pathogenesis. The inability
to histologically characterize the early stages of HPV-induced OP tumorigenesis continues to hinder efforts to
diagnose OP precancerous lesions and assess cancer risk. Currently, there is no animal model for HPV-induced
oral infections and malignancies in the context of HIV-induced immunosuppression. In previous collaborative
efforts, the Ozbun and Traina-Dorge labs have successfully modeled cervical HPV infections and neoplasia in
female rhesus macaques (RMs) using Macca mulatta papillomavirus type 1 (MmPV1), a close relative of HPV16,
which causes 90-97% of HPV-OPSCC. In this R21 proposal, we will build on our prior work and collective
expertise with MmPV1, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), and non-human primate immunology to establish
a Rhesus macaque model of persistent oral HPV and HIV co-infection with which to study oral MmPV1 infections,
persistence, precancer, and OPSCC induction. This model is innovative and advantageous because both
MmPV1 and SIV recapitulate their respective infections and pathogenesis in RMs like their human counterparts:
MmPV1 is carcinogenic in its natural RM host, and these animals develop immunosuppression following SIV
infection. As HPV-OPSCCs are more common in males, we will expose immunosuppressed SIV-infected male
RMs to high-titer infectious MmPV1 virions in the tongue base, the palatine tonsil, and the soft palate. In AIM 1,
we will determine the oral infectivity and persistence of MmPV1 virions in SIV-infected and immunosuppressed
RMs. At timed intervals and in post-mortem tissues, we will assess MmPV1 viral loads and DNA persistence at
the sites of infection, and we will screen for localized viral shedding, preneoplastic oropharyngeal MmPV1
lesions, and disease progression. We will also measure circulating tumor MmPV1 DNA over time as a potential
biomarker of the onset of preneoplasia and/or OPSCC. In AIM 2, we will evaluate SIV- and MmPV1-induced
changes in RM biospecimens. At timed intervals, we will quantify plasma and saliva cytokine/chemokine levels
by Mesoscale immunoassays and assess HPV-disease-associated markers in cytobrush exfoliated OP cells and
endpoint post-mortem tissues by immunohistochemistry. These assays will identify biological pathways altered
by both viruses and determine potential disease correlates. Establishing a non-human primate model for OP PV
infections and precancers will facilitate expanded follow-up studies aimed at revealing mechanisms of MmPV1
infection, persistence, and progression from precancer to malignancy in the context of SIV-induced
immunosuppression; it will also promote efforts to diagnose and treat OP precancers.",Development of a Rhesus Macaque Model of Persistent Oral HPV and HIV Co-infection to Study Oropharyngeal Cancer Induction,"PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE
Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) is an
extremely important public health problem with increasing incidence, especially in human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. However, the role that HIV immunosuppression
plays in the development of HPV-OPSCCs is poorly understood, and currently, there is no animal
model for HPV-induced oral infections and malignancies in the context of HIV-induced
immunosuppression. The studies we propose will characterize and establish a needed rhesus
macaque model of persistent oral HPV and HIV co-infection using Macaca mulatta papillomavirus

"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Conference on
 Protein Homeostasis in Health and Disease
 April 24 - 28, 2024
ABSTRACT
This proposal is a request for financial support for a meeting on PROTEIN HOMEOSTASIS IN
HEALTH AND DISEASE to be held at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory from April 24 - 28, 2024.
This meeting is the premier international forum for presentation of new results in this exciting area
across biology and medicine and is attended by representatives from virtually every major
laboratory in the field. The explosion of new information on how the folded state of proteins is
acquired and maintained in vivo and the relevance of this process to essentially all biological
processes for healthy aging and risk for degenerative diseases of aging including
neurodegeneration, cancer, and metabolism guarantees an excitement and urgency of this
meeting. Because of the recent developments on stress signaling in aging and disease, we will
open the meeting with this session to integrate across diverse forms of cell stress responses
followed by sessions on chaperone mechanisms and co-translational folding and ribosome quality
control. We will then explore the roles of stress granules and phase transitions, protein
degradative mechanisms, organellar proteostasis and misfolding and aggregation in aging and
neurodegenerative diseases. We will close with a session on therapeutic strategies for protein
conformational diseases of aging. These fundamental questions are at the heart of the biology of
proteostasis that will be complemented by the sessions on aging and proteostasis failure in
diseases of protein misfolding including Alzheimer’s disease, ALS, Parkinson’s disease and
Huntington’s disease. The themes of aging, proteostasis failure, and diseases of protein
misfolding are well integrated throughout each session, and emerging principles on protein client
interactions and alternate protein conformations will be dominantly displayed. The diverse protein
quality control strategies used by compartments of the cell to ensure the integrity of the secretory
and organellar pathways during times of protein folding stress will be represented by emerging
topics on spatial quality control within a cell. The field of heat shock proteins and molecular
chaperones has grown exponentially and draws interest not only from traditional scientific
disciplines in the basic sciences but also from diverse areas of biomedical research including
neurodegenerative disease, infectious diseases, cancer, heart disease and aging. The meeting
will have eight lecture sessions, two poster sessions, two lightning presentation sessions, a (new)
panel discussion on careers in science and a daily lunch with the speakers. The sessions include:
1) Cell Stress Response in Biology, Aging and Disease; 2) Chaperone Mechanisms; 3) Co-
translational Folding and Ribosome Quality Control; 4) Stress Granules, Phase Transitions and
Intrinsically Disordered Proteins; 5) Degradation Mechanisms - Autophagy Lysosomal Pathway
and the Ubiquitin Proteasome System; 6) Misfolding and Aggregation in Aging and
Neurodegenerative Diseases; 7) Organellar Proteostasis and Spatial Quality Control in Aging and
Disease; and 8) Therapeutic Strategies for Protein Conformational Diseases of Aging. Each
session will consist of eight to nine oral presentations and will be co-chaired by an invited speaker.
Generally, two speakers will be pre-invited per session with the remainder to be selected from
submitted abstracts, thus ~60-65% of speakers will be from submitted abstracts to ensure balance
of junior investigators, gender, and all forms of diversity. As well, we will have two lightning
sessions, each with ten talks each of 2 min. to highlight key presentations from the poster
sessions. This balance of talks allows the meeting to feature presentations by leading scientists,
to be responsive to exciting new developments, and to encourage diverse participation that
recognizes new investigators.",CSHL 2024 Protein Homeostasis in Health and Disease Conference,"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Conference on

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Proteins are composed of polymers of amino acids (or polypeptides) and execute essential tasks
in all living organisms. Protein function is critically dependent on the folding of their constituent
polypeptides into active three-dimensional structures through the interactions of molecular
chaperones. Protein homeostasis is achieved by balanced synthesis, folding, translocation and
degradation of proteins. Experimental evidence accumulated in the recent past has revealed that
failure of protein homeostasis in aging leads to some of the most devastating diseases affecting
humanity. The latter include common neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson’s Disease
and Alzheimer’s Disease, common metabolic disorders such as Diabetes and a host of other age-
related conditions. The Cold Spring Harbor Meeting on Protein Homeostasis in Health and
Disease brings together experts in diverse aspects of protein folding, the cellular response to
protein misfolding and diseases and therapeutic approaches for age-associated diseases of
protein homeostasis. As such it serves as the premier clearinghouse for ideas on how to
eventually translate the basic discoveries in the area to future treatments of recalcitrant diseases.",https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10895732,Affect;Age;Aging;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Amino Acids;Amyloidosis;Area;Attention;Autophagocytosis;Basic Science;Binding;Biochemical;Biogenesis;Biological Process;Biology;Biomedical Research;Biophysics;Businesses;Cell Aging;Cell Compartmentation;Cell Physiology;Cells;Cellular Stress;Client;Communicable Diseases;Complement;Complex;Data;Degenerative Disorder;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Discipline;Disease;Ensure;Environment;Equilibrium;Explosion;Faculty;Failure;Feedback;Financial Support;Fostering;Future;Gender;General Population;Goals;Health;Heart;Heart Diseases;Heat shock proteins;Heat-Shock Response;Homeostasis;Humanities;Huntington Disease;Impairment;In Vitro;Industry;Institution;International;Knowledge;Laboratories;Lightning;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Medicine;Metabolic Diseases;Metabolism;Methods;Molecular Chaperones;Nerve Degeneration;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Oral;Organism;Parkinson Disease;Participant;Pathway interactions;Phase Transition;Physiology;Polymers;Postdoctoral Fellow;Prion Diseases;Process;Protein Biosynthesis;Protein Conformation;Proteins;Quality Control;Questionnaires;Recording of previous events;Rejuvenation;Research Institute;Research Personnel;Ribosomes;Risk;Role;Schedule;Science;Scientist;Signal Transduction;Slide;Stress;System;Therapeutic;Thinking;Toxic effect;Translating;Ubiquitin;Work;age related;arm;biological adaptation to stress;career;cell type;graduate student;healthy aging;hormonal signals;in vivo;insight;interest;lectures;macromolecular assembly;meetings;model organism;multicatalytic endopeptidase complex;novel therapeutic intervention;polypeptide;posters;protein aggregation;protein degradation;protein folding;protein function;protein misfolding;proteostasis;repaired;response;skills;stress granule;success;symposium;three dimensional structure;virtual,10895732,1R13AG087518-01,huntington disease,2,0.72,0.54,fals,,"these fundamental questions are at the heart of the biology of

"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cannabis is the most commonly used federally illicit drug in the US, with rates increasing, particularly in young
adults. Since 2012, 22 states legalized cannabis for non-medical (i.e., recreational) use and have established
regulatory oversight for product safety. Meanwhile, derived psychoactive cannabis products (DPCPs; e.g., Delta-
8 THC) entered the US market as a result of the 2018 US Farm Bill, which classified cannabis products with
<0.3% Delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) by dry weight as hemp, making DPCPs federally legal, but
unregulated. Although some states have prohibited or regulated DPCPs, others have not addressed DPCP
legality. As a result of this complex and/or ambiguous regulatory context, DPCPs introduce new public health
concerns (e.g., use in young people, contaminants, poisonings). This line of research aims to advance evidence-
based policy and practice to reduce cannabis and DPCP use, its consequences, and related inequities. Guided
by a multilevel Social Determinants of Health lens, we will examine legal, commercial, and individual
determinants of cannabis and DPCP use outcomes. While research on the impact of legalizing non-medical
cannabis on cannabis use has yielded mixed results, cannabis marketing/retail are well-documented
determinants of cannabis perceptions (e.g., risk, social norms), use motives, and use outcomes. Limited
research has focused on DPCPs given their recent emergence. There may be similarities in determinants of
DPCP vs. cannabis use (e.g., sociodemographic correlates). However, there may be key legal and commercial
determinants that differ; for example, DPCPs may be more popular in states without legal non-medical cannabis,
and DPCPs may use distinct marketing strategies. Given the complex federal vs. state policy/regulatory context
of cannabis and DPCPs, it is crucial to understand determinants and their impact on individual cannabis and
DPCP use outcomes in order to inform laws/regulations and interventions to address use and related inequities.
Our specific aims are to: 1) examine cannabis and DPCP marketing characteristics over time (2018-2024) with
regard to regulatory context and potential target consumers, using existing marketing surveillance data; 2)
examine associations between cannabis and DPCP state policy, marketing, individual determinants
(perceptions, use motives), use, and related consequences (e.g., driving after use), using longitudinal data of
4,000 young adults ages 18-34 in an ongoing R01; and 3) qualitatively assess young adults’ cannabis- and
DPCP-specific experiences with, and perceptions of, legal and commercial determinants of cannabis and DPCP
use (via semi-structured interviews). Building on Dr. LoParco’s existing knowledge and skills, the training goals
focus on: 1) legal and commercial determinants of health; 2) qualitative/mixed methods research and advanced
quantitative analysis; and 3) professional development. This study will yield novel, high-impact, policy-relevant
findings and uses rigorous methods to address NIDA research priorities and will facilitate the successful launch
of Dr. LoParco’s independent research career focused on cannabis policy, industry, and population impact.",Socio-structural determinants of cannabis and derived psychoactive cannabis product use and consequences among young adults,"PROJECT NARRATIVE

 GLIA IN HEALTH & DISEASE
 August 20 – 24, 2024
Abstract
The proposed meeting on Glia in Health & Disease will be held August 20 – 24, 2024 at Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory. The goal of this conference is to provide an active forum for exchange of results in the rapidly
advancing fields of glial biology and neuron-glia interactions. Glial cells comprise a diverse group of non-
neuronal cells that are essential for nervous system development, circuit function, and disease. Glia perform
many important roles, such as regulating the development of neural circuits, modulating neurotransmitter
signaling between neurons, providing metabolic support to many nervous system cells, supporting the fast and
efficient propagation of action potentials, modulating vascular development and blood flow, and regulating the
propagation of pathology and inflammatory cascades in disease. With the advancement of genetic tools to
specifically target glia, we are now gaining a deeper mechanistic understanding of how glial cells function in
health and disease. This includes mechanisms highlighting glia actively modulate neural circuit function,
plasticity, and behavior under healthy, steady-state conditions. We are also now appreciating how these
functions go awry in pathological states, leading to circuit dysfunction, chronic inflammation, and destruction of
neurons and their synaptic connections. There are also clear indications that glia may not only react to
diseased neurons to propagate disease, but they are a part of the underlying etiology. For example, many
gene mutations linked to neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease and multiple sclerosis, are
in genes enriched in glia. Further genetic manipulation studies are beginning to reveal how these mutations
alter glial cell function and contribute actively to the earliest initiation and propagation of these diseases.
Adding to the complexity in disease, glia can also be beneficial and promote regeneration and tissue repair by
performing functions such as providing metabolic support, engulfing debris, and forming protective glial scars.
This meeting will highlight the latest developments in glial cell biology obtained through studies of invertebrate
and vertebrate model systems, as well as human tissue and cells, using the most up-to-date genetics,
molecular biology, biochemistry, physiology, and imaging technologies. Using the goals and format of the
previous nine extremely successful meetings as a guide, we will: 1) assemble a diverse meeting of scientists
engaged in studies of glial biology and neuron-glia interactions; 2) showcase the newest and most exciting
developments through talks selected based on scientific merit from openly submitted abstracts; 3) empower
junior scientists to present their work and engage with established investigators; and 4) foster collaborations for
accelerated discovery.",CSHL 2024 Conference on Glia in Health & Disease,"2024 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Conference
 GLIA IN HEALTH & DISEASE
 PROJECT NARRATIVE
The intricate functioning of the nervous system relies not only on the activity of neurons
but also on the crucial contributions of glial cells. The “Glia in Health and Disease”
conference, hosted biennially since 2006, remains the preeminent glial meeting. This
meeting unites a diverse assembly of researchers investigating basic, fundamental
biological mechanisms by which glia contribute to brain circuit development and function
to translational neuroscientists who identify new glia-based targets for therapeutic

"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is an urgent need for the development of new approaches to treat patients suffering from cystic fibrosis
(CF). CF results in a poor quality of life and a median life expectancy in the U.S. of only ~46 years of age, despite
a number of available drugs. In CF, persisting chronic lung infections with severe acute pulmonary exacerbations
and non-resolving airway hyper-inflammation driven by lung neutrophilia result in tissue damage and the
irreversible decline of lung function. We have recently demonstrated the therapeutic potential of low dose
exogenous carbon monoxide (CO) in preclinical CF models, by reducing inflammation without compromising
immune function.
To date, inhaled CO gas (iCO) and CO bound to carrier molecules (CORMs) have been the modalities of choice
in the majority of animal and clinical studies, and the safety and tolerability of low dose CO has been
demonstrated in 22 successful Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies, including in patients with pulmonary conditions
such as ARDS and COPD. However, iCO and CORMS are not expected to be pharmaceutically acceptable and
viable therapeutic options in CF patients due to, for iCO, the risk of accidental inhalation exposure from the
presence of compressed CO gas cylinders and imprecise dosing, especially in CF patients that have limited and
variable respiratory function, and, for CORMs, problematic release kinetics and toxicological concerns with
carrier molecules. The objective of the proposed project is to investigate HBI-002, a novel oral low dose CO drug
product that enables the use of low dose CO in CF.
HBI-002 is an oral liquid drug product containing CO. Dosing and follow up in a Phase 1 clinical study under IND
in healthy adult subjects with HBI-002 have been completed demonstrating safety and appropriate
pharmacokinetics as measured by Cmax, though final data analysis is ongoing. The next step in development is
to demonstrate that HBI-002 is effective in clinically relevant animal models of CF as has been shown with other
forms of CO and to better understand the potential mechanism(s) of action. Based upon the substantial literature
of CO in chronic inflammatory conditions and our findings in CF models, our central hypothesis that will be tested
in this project is: HBI-002 will reduce neutrophilic pathological inflammation in the CF lung without
compromising the immune response to infection in experimental mouse models of CF.",HBI-002 for Cystic Fibrosis,"PROJECT NARRATIVE
This proposal is intended to support research evaluating whether HBI-002, an oral low dose carbon monoxide
(CO) drug product, can improve outcomes in animal models of cystic fibrosis. If successful, the project will

"HIV associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) affects ~50% of people living with HIV (PWH), and concurrent
opioid use disorder (OUD) can enhance symptoms. Since CNS pathology in HIV associated neurocognitive
disorder (HAND) bears similarities to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other ‘tauopathies’ in which accumulation of
abnormally phosphorylated Tau protein (pTau) is considered a critical factor in the development/progression of
cognitive symptoms, it is reasonable to think that pTau may have a role in driving cognitive dysfunction in
HIV/HAND. Compared to AD, cognitive changes in HAND are measured earlier and only ≤5% result in dementia.
While post-mortem studies have documented pTau species within HAND+ and OUD brain tissue, and we see
pTau deposition in animal models of HAND/OUD that exhibit cognitive decline, the question of whether pTau
triggers deficits in neuron function that underlie HAND/OUD is not clear. The studies proposed here will clarify
whether pTau has a causal role. Our preliminary and published work shows that multiple pathologic forms of
pTau are present in specific brain regions of a murine model of HAND, and that pTau levels are increased by 2-
8 wks of concurrent morphine exposure. These findings coincide with cognitive issues and motor dysfunction,
as well as in situ physiological changes in neurons in specific brain regions, including hippocampus. We propose
functional studies to connect these interrelated findings, testing the hypothesis that tau/pTau is a critical driver
of cognitive dysfunction in HAND and the exacerbation by opioids. Studies evaluate (i) CA1 pyramidal cell (PC)
output; (ii) a CA1 microcircuit of interneurons that are vulnerable to Tat and express µ-opioid receptor. Functional
assessments use (i) patch-clamp physiology, and (ii) miniscopes to follow activity of individual neurons for 12
weeks in awake, behaving mice (inscopix.com). Physiological (patch clamp), histological and biochemical
damage are evaluated on tissue from individual behaving mice so that all outcomes can be directly correlated.
While pTau is elevated in several brain regions, we focus on hippocampus, an area critical to normal cognitive
processes which is clearly involved in a multiple conditions of cognitive decline. Two transgenic models of HAND
in virally suppressed PWH that exhibit cognitive dysfunction (inducible CNS expression of HIV Tat; Tg26) are
used to suggest relative contributions of Tat vs other HIV proteins in HAND. Longitudinal, 12 week studies
evaluate gain- (Cre/AAV) and loss-of-pTau function on cognitive behavior and neuron dysfunction/damage in
both sexes. The loss-of-pTau studies employ 2 models. The primary model is treatment with TRx023, an anti-
pTau drug with significant effects in a Phase III clinical trial (TauRx.com). Because it is given during the disease
process it is clinically relevant. The second model, judiciously undertaken based on TRx0237 results, is to create
a new line of Tat+ or Tg26 mice crossed with a Tau-deficient transgenic (Tau-/-) that will eliminate Tau/pTau
completely and constituitively. Overall, the studies represent a comprehensive approach that tests the role of
pTau in HAND/OUD using a design for direct correlations between tissue level damage and cognitive decline.",pTau-related neuron and cognitive dysfunction in opioid-HIV comorbidity: Longitudinal and functional studies,"Abnormally phosphoryated Tau protein (pTau) is implicated as causative in Alzheimer's Disease and certain
other cognitive disorders, and is also commonly observed in persons with cognitive changes in opioid use
disorder (OUD) and in HIV/HAND. Both gain-of-function (AAV/Cre techniques) and loss-of-function (Tau
knockout mice crossed to HAND models; Tau aggregation reduced pharmacologically) studies test the
hypothesis that pTau production and aggregation cause/escalate cognitive dysfunction in OUD, in
HIV/HAND, and to opiate-induced exacerbation of HAND. Neuron activity, pathology, biochemistry are
measured in mice that are studied behaviorally so that direct correlations can be made; miniscopes are used

"We propose a novel approach for identifying skeletal trait patterns that predict fracture risk in older men and
women, independent of areal bone mineral density (aBMD). The breakthrough was finding that aBMD loss
results from different relative proportions of decline in bone mineral content (BMC) and increase in bone area
based on baseline external bone size. aBMD is often used as a surrogate of strength, and loss in aBMD is often
assumed to reflect loss in strength. However, this association has been predicated on an implicit assumption
that the proportion of BMC-declines to area-increases is similar among individuals which our data contradict. In
the proposed work, we will test the global hypothesis that external bone size is associated with variation in
strength-decline trajectory and fracture risk, independent of aBMD. This hypothesis is supported by preliminary
cadaveric studies showing different strength-age regressions for narrow and wide subgroups. Moreover, we
show that low aBMD may explain fracture risk within subgroups stratified by external bone size but did not explain
the two-fold increase in fracture risk between subgroups. Thus, we have identified limitations in the uniform
application of aBMD to predict fracture risk, suggesting that recognizing population heterogeneity is necessary
for advancing fracture risk prediction. To address these limitations, we will identify the structural traits that explain
fracture risk within subgroups and test the hypothesis that the structural traits predicting fracture risk differ among
the subgroups. We first leverage high resolution imaging and direct mechanical tests available for cadaveric
femurs to test the hypothesis that the structural trait patterns determining low femur strength vary with external
femur size (Aim 1). To systematically identify structural patterns associated with variation in fracture risk and
strength-decline trajectories, we will use statistical shape and trait modeling within a novel computational
framework to identify the specific structural patterns that best predict experimental strength and then test how
these associations differ with external size, sex, and race. We address how these structure-function relationships
change over time by leveraging existing longitudinal hip DXA data for elderly White men enrolled in the
Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS) and elderly White women enrolled in Health ABC (Aim 2) and
elderly Black men and women enrolled in Health ABC (Aim 3). We will test the hypothesis that strength-decline
trajectories differ between baseline FN area tertiles for older men and women, and that the strength-trajectory is
associated with risk of fracture within tertiles. Successful completion of these aims will provide evidence of
multiple biomechanical pathways leading to reduced proximal femur strength in older men and women and will
identify sets of traits and trait interactions that best predict fracture risk for subgroups of individuals. This outcome
will explain why changes in aBMD track strength-decline for some but not all individuals, and will identify early
indicators of fragility fractures, providing a voice to what has been called a silent disease.",Heterogeneous pathways to bone strength decline and hip fracture,"We will test the global hypothesis that external bone size is associated with variation in hip strength-decline

"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The NIH-funded aquatic model stock centers have expressed concerns over growing needs for them and their
associated research communities to use germplasm repositories in preservation and sharing of genetic
resources. Because of a lack of comprehensive repository capabilities, the National Xenopus Resource (NXR),
Ambystoma Genetic Resource Center (AGSC), and National Resource for Aplysia (NRA) face many challenges
such as the risk of losing valuable genetic lines. In the ongoing R24 project (2020-2024) we have developed or
improved practical approaches for sperm cryopreservation for NXR and AGSC, and we are making breakthrough
progress in embryo and larvae cryopreservation for NRA. For Xenopus, we developed a standardizable,
streamlined pathway which is scalable and substantially improves throughput and quality assurance. For
Ambystoma we developed a de novo cryopreservation protocol and expanded it into a functional pathway which
produced a 50% fertilization rate with thawed sperm. For Aplysia, we have recently achieved short-term (>10 hr)
post-thaw survival of free-swimming larvae by vitrification. During this project, we have collaborated closely with
the stock centers and responded to their needs through hundreds of interactions including site visits, training
visits, phone calls, remote meetings, and workshops. In addition, we have developed a central “Hub” at the
Aquatic Germplasm and Genetic Resource Center (AGGRC) that supports resource sharing among the stock
centers, the USDA National Animal Germplasm Program, and user communities leading to the creation of a NIH
Aquatic Biomedical Germplasm Repository Network. In sum, the ongoing Hub R24 project has developed basic
reproductive and cryopreservation protocols and customized these based on the specific resources and needs
of the stock centers. Based on this success, the overall goal of this proposed renewal R24 Hub work is to advance
the capabilities at the resource centers from feasibility establishment to operational repositories with high-
throughput production and routine quality management programs. Proposed translational research will focus on
building practical capabilities at the stock-center level for amphibians; expanded fundamental research and
characterization will proceed at the AGGRC for Aplysia, and resource sharing platforms will be established at
the stock center and research community levels. To facilitate resource sharing and distribution, we will advance
the NIH Aquatic Biomedical Germplasm Repository Network from proof of concept to establishment of formal
operations. This will ensure that research communities will have access to valuable genetic lines that may
otherwise be at risk of being lost. The specific aims are: 1) Develop high-throughput sperm cryopreservation
pathways and quality management programs for operational repository capabilities at NXR and AGSC; 2)
Develop operational repository capabilities for early life stages of Aplysia sea hares and the algae species
required for Aplysia feeding and larval development, and 3) Advance the AGGRC Hub and NIH Aquatic

"Project Summary
This project aims to use multiple secondary demographic and health data sets to identify the demographic and
behavioral pathways responsible for increasing rural mortality disadvantages for women. The goal is to first
determine how rural women’s mortality varies across county-level demographic factors and how it has changed
over time in the context of shifting demographic patterns that have brought new residents into rural regions due
to jobs, retirement, or Covid-19 migration. It also aims to understand how rural women’s health lifestyles or
combinations of health behaviors have shifted over time in response to new residents and the relative
consequences of these behaviors on health and mortality. By Identifying how these different compositional and
contextual county-level factors have changed over time across various degrees of rurality, ranging from the
least to most rural counties, we will ultimately identify the risk factors and potential intervention points to
increase the healthy lifespan for rural women.",Rural Health Lifestyles: The role of demographic change and migration shifts on rural women's health,,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10770250,Alcohol consumption;Alcohols;Area;Behavior;Behavioral;Benefits and Risks;Big Data;Body mass index;COVID-19;Centers of Research Excellence;Characteristics;Country;County;Data;Data Set;Data Sources;Dedications;Demographic Factors;Demography;Disadvantaged;Economics;Ethnic Origin;Future;Goals;Grant;Growth;Health;Health Services Accessibility;Health behavior;Immigrant;Immigration;Individual;Individual Adjustment;Intervention;Investments;Knowledge;Life Style;Longevity;Maternal Mortality;Mentors;Metabolic Diseases;Migrant;Occupations;Out-Migrations;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physical activity;Poisoning;Policies;Population;Population Dynamics;Poverty;Race;Research;Research Personnel;Resources;Retirement;Risk;Risk Factors;Role;Rural;Rural Health;Saints;Smoking;Social Change;Socioeconomic Status;Time;Typology;Unemployment;United States National Institutes of Health;Urbanization;Woman;Women&apos;s Health;Work;behavior change;data infrastructure;data sharing;disadvantaged women;driving force;experience;health care availability;health care service utilization;health data;health difference;improved;men;migration;mortality;programs;response;rural area;rural counties;rurality;social;social factors;sociodemographics;trend,10770250,1P20GM152280-01,,,,,,,,"['alcohol consumption', 'alcohols', 'area', 'behavior', 'behavioral', 'benefits and risks', 'big data', 'body mass index', 'covid-19', 'centers of research excellence', 'characteristics', 'country', 'county', 'data', 'data set', 'data sources', 'dedications', 'demographic factors', 'demography', 'disadvantaged', 'economics', 'ethnic origin', 'future', 'goals', 'grant', 'growth', 'health', 'health services accessibility', 'health behavior', 'immigrant', 'immigration', 'individual', 'individual adjustment', 'intervention', 'investments', 'knowledge', 'life style', 'longevity', 'maternal mortality', 'mentors', 'metabolic diseases', 'migrant', 'occupations', 'out-migrations', 'pathway interactions', 'pattern', 'pharmaceutical preparations', 'physical activity', 'poisoning', 'policies', 'population', 'population dynamics', 'poverty', 'race', 'research', 'research personnel', 'resources', 'retirement', 'risk', 'risk factors', 'role', 'rural', 'rural health', 'saints', 'smoking', 'social change', 'socioeconomic status', 'time', 'typology', 'unemployment', 'united states national institutes of health', 'urbanization', 'woman', 'women&apos', 's health', 'work', 'behavior change', 'data infrastructure', 'data sharing', 'disadvantaged women', 'driving force', 'experience', 'health care availability', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'health difference', 'improved', 'men', 'migration', 'mortality', 'programs', 'response', 'rural area', 'rural counties', 'rurality', 'social', 'social factors', 'sociodemographics', 'trend']",,
"ABSTRACT – Genomic Imprinting in the Development of NAFLD
By 2030, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is projected to affect more than 100 million
Americans, including 10 million children. NAFLD results from overaccumulation of fat in the liver and
can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and cirrhosis, leading to significant morbidity and mortality
even among children and adolescents. Accumulating evidence indicates that early life exposures alter
gene expression and influence the risk for NAFLD, but regions of the genome targeted by these
exposures remain unclear. We hypothesize that aberrant methylation at imprint control regions (ICRs),
discrete loci which regulate expression of specific genes and the function of gene networks, contributes
substantially to NAFLD. Measuring the impact of epigenetic modifications that alter NAFLD risk has
been challenging due to the lack of tools for comprehensive measurement of epigenetic modifications,
longitudinal data, cohort diversity, accurate non-invasive markers of liver fat and fibrosis, as well as the
temporal ambiguity between exposure and outcomes. To overcome these obstacles, we have
comprehensively identified DNA methylation-controlled regulatory regions for genomically imprinted
genes, many of which are implicated in metabolic disease, growth and development. Once established
in the gametes, these ICRs are stably transmitted during mitotic cell division and are thus very similar
across tissues. Importantly, imprinted genes play key roles in growth and metabolism, underscoring
plausibility in the etiology of NAFLD. The overarching goal is to utilize these novel ICRs to identify
methylation changes associated with NAFLD development. We will leverage the resources of our multi-
ethnic, pre-birth, longitudinal cohort, the Newborn Epigenetics STudy (NEST) to evaluate the oldest
500 children (17-21 years). We will identify ICRs at birth associated with increased liver fat, NAFLD,
and liver fibrosis using magnetic resonance imaging as well as intermediate markers of NAFLD and
metabolic dysfunction. ICR methylation will be examined in relation to metabolic outcomes, sex,
ethnicity and early life exposures. A 1-year follow-up of 200 adolescents will determine stability of the
associations. Finally, we will validate the ICR status of NAFLD-associated genes in different tissue
types to determine their ability to serve as early markers of disease risk. This proposal will contribute
significantly to knowledge on the relationship between genomic imprinting and NAFLD and clarify risk-
mediating regions and exposures that can be used to develop early detection and therapeutic tools to
combat the NAFLD epidemic.",Genomic Imprinting in the Development of NAFLD,"PROJECT NARRATIVE
The association between early life exposures and development of non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD) in children and young adults may be mediated by epigenetic
mechanisms; however, the specific epigenetic modifications implicated in NAFLD risk
remain largely unknown. We recently identified 1,488 novel putative human imprinted
gene control regions throughout the genome and our goal is to identify aberrant
methylation in those imprint control regions that is associated with the development of
NAFLD. We propose one of the most rigorous investigations of this association,
leveraging a large, multi-ethnic birth cohort with longitudinal data and specimens from
birth to young adulthood, state of the art imaging of liver fat content and fibrosis, and a
novel array able to systematically measure methylation at all imprint control regions –
mechanistically linking early life to NAFLD and laying the foundation for improved early
detection.",https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10772390,Adolescence;Adolescent;Adult;Affect;American;Birth;Blood Tests;Blood specimen;Cell division;Characteristics;Child;Childhood;Circulation;Cirrhosis;Clinical;Clinical Research;CpG dinucleotide;DNA Methylation;Data;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;Disease Marker;Early Diagnosis;Enrollment;Environmental Exposure;Enzymes;Epidemic;Epigenetic Process;Ethnic Origin;Etiology;Exhibits;Fatty acid glycerol esters;Fibrosis;Foundations;Gametogenesis;Gene Dosage;Gene Expression;Genes;Genome;Genomic Imprinting;Germ Cells;Goals;Growth;Growth and Development function;Health;Heritability;Human;Image;Inflammation;Investigation;Knowledge;Leukocytes;Life;Life Cycle Stages;Link;Lipids;Liver;Liver Dysfunction;Liver Fibrosis;Longitudinal cohort;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Maps;Measurement;Measures;Mediating;Metabolic;Metabolic Diseases;Metabolic dysfunction;Metabolism;Methylation;Mitotic;Modification;Morbidity - disease rate;Newborn Infant;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences;Obesity;Outcome;Play;Positioning Attribute;Pregnant Women;Promoter Regions;Public Health;Publishing;Questionnaires;Regulation;Regulator Genes;Resources;Risk;Role;Somatic Cell;Specimen;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Tissues;Triglycerides;Umbilical Cord Blood;Work;aged;chronic liver disease;cohort;combat;disease natural history;disorder risk;early detection biomarkers;early life exposure;elastography;end stage liver disease;follow-up;gene function;gene network;imprint;improved;inter-individual variation;liver imaging;mortality;multi-ethnic;non-alcoholic fatty liver disease;nonalcoholic steatohepatitis;novel;pediatric non-alcoholic fatty liver disease;peripheral blood;recruit;response;sex;tool;transmission process;ultrasound;waist circumference;young adult,10772390,1R01DK137764-01,,,,,,,,"['adolescence', 'adolescent', 'adult', 'affect', 'american', 'birth', 'blood tests', 'blood specimen', 'cell division', 'characteristics', 'child', 'childhood', 'circulation', 'cirrhosis', 'clinical', 'clinical research', 'cpg dinucleotide', 'dna methylation', 'data', 'development', 'diagnosis', 'disease', 'disease marker', 'early diagnosis', 'enrollment', 'environmental exposure', 'enzymes', 'epidemic', 'epigenetic process', 'ethnic origin', 'etiology', 'exhibits', 'fatty acid glycerol esters', 'fibrosis', 'foundations', 'gametogenesis', 'gene dosage', 'gene expression', 'genes', 'genome', 'genomic imprinting', 'germ cells', 'goals', 'growth', 'growth and development function', 'health', 'heritability', 'human', 'image', 'inflammation', 'investigation', 'knowledge', 'leukocytes', 'life', 'life cycle stages', 'link', 'lipids', 'liver', 'liver dysfunction', 'liver fibrosis', 'longitudinal cohort', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'maps', 'measurement', 'measures', 'mediating', 'metabolic', 'metabolic diseases', 'metabolic dysfunction', 'metabolism', 'methylation', 'mitotic', 'modification', 'morbidity - disease rate', 'newborn infant', 'non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus', 'nucleic acid regulatory sequences', 'obesity', 'outcome', 'play', 'positioning attribute', 'pregnant women', 'promoter regions', 'public health', 'publishing', 'questionnaires', 'regulation', 'regulator genes', 'resources', 'risk', 'role', 'somatic cell', 'specimen', 'technology', 'testing', 'therapeutic', 'time', 'tissues', 'triglycerides', 'umbilical cord blood', 'work', 'aged', 'chronic liver disease', 'cohort', 'combat', 'disease natural history', 'disorder risk', 'early detection biomarkers', 'early life exposure', 'elastography', 'end stage liver disease', 'follow-up', 'gene function', 'gene network', 'imprint', 'improved', 'inter-individual variation', 'liver imaging', 'mortality', 'multi-ethnic', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'pediatric non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'peripheral blood', 'recruit', 'response', 'sex', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'ultrasound', 'waist circumference', 'young adult']",,
"Project Summary
Lead (Pb) poisoning is a persistent health issue in the United States due to legacy contamination from
Pb-based sources such as paint, plumbing, and gasoline. Children are most susceptible to Pb
poisoning, which causes persistent cognitive deficits and low IQ. The specific mechanisms by which Pb
poisoning impacts development are not fully understood, however. Previous research showed that Pb
impacts several thyroid hormone (TH)-related processes, including decreases in expression of TH
distributor proteins (THDPs) in the choroid plexus. This is an important issue because TH is a critical
regulator of brain development; disrupted TH signaling in utero leads to smaller brain size and mental
retardation. The impact of Pb-induced THDP impairment on development has not been fully tested.
Given the impact of Pb on THDP expression, our central hypothesis is that Pb poisoning impairs TH
distribution into the brain and compromises TH-dependent developmental mechanisms. TH regulates
important aspects of brain development in both humans and amphibian, in some surprisingly similar
ways. The overall rationale of this proposal is that TH is the key driver of metamorphosis in frogs, which
makes tadpoles ideally suited to address how Pb dysregulates TH-dependent mechanisms of
development. We will use Xenopus laevis tadpoles to assess the impact of Pb on the expression and
function of THDPs in the choroid plexus and its effects on TH-sensitive cellular and molecular
mechanisms brain development. The central hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1) To
determine the effects of Pb poisoning on expression of THDPs, TH-sensitive genes, neurogenesis,
neuronal differentiation, and spine maturation using time-lapse in vivo imaging techniques. 2) To test if
knockdown of THDP expression in the choroid plexus mimics the effects of Pb poisoning. 3) To test if
overexpression of THDPs in the choroid plexus can counter the effects of Pb-poisoning on TH-
dependent mechanisms of brain development. The outcomes of this research will test a significantly
understudied mechanism by which Pb is hypothesized to compromise development. These protocols
will serve as a new, unique set of sensitive end points to evaluate not just heavy metals but any chemical
suspected of disrupting THDP expression and function. This proposal is innovative because it uses
advanced techniques that have not been previously used in animals to address the issue of
developmental Pb neurotoxicity. This project is significant because it will conclusively test the degree
to which Pb affects development via dysregulation of TH-signaling and therefore may lead to
alternative/complimentary therapies for counteracting Pb-poisoning in children.",Does lead (Pb) poisoning impair brain development by affecting how thyroid hormone gets into the brain?,"Project Narrative

"Abstract
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a genetic disorder caused by bi-allelic inactivating mutations in tumor
suppressor genes TSC1 or TSC2, leading to progressive lung destruction and eventually the requirement for
lung transplantation. Rapalogs, the only FDA-approved treatments for LAM, induce a cytostatic effect with
stabilized lung function. However, lung function continues to decline upon treatment cessation. Thus, there is
an urgent need for better treatment, potentially leading to a cure for this devastating disease.
The monogenetic nature of LAM makes messenger RNA (mRNA) replacement an attractive therapeutic
modality, which requires safe and efficacious delivery of functional mRNA to the lung and specifically into TSC-
deficient cells. We have developed lung-specific synthetic lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and showed in our
preliminary data that in vivo organ-selectivity of LNPs can be precisely tuned by changing the linker structure in
the lipidoid tails without complicating the LNPs formulation. Furthermore, we developed LAM cell-targeting hybrid
LNPs that efficiently deliver functional TSC2 mRNA into TSC2-deficient cells and suppress mTORC1 pathway.
mRNA replacement therapy significantly reduced tumor burdens in preclinical LAM models. Remarkably, mRNA
therapy induced T cell tumor infiltration in the otherwise immune cold tumor microenvironment.
We hypothesize: 1) improved lung-specific tumor-targeting LNPs will assist developing mRNA therapy for LAM,
which provides a novel therapeutic strategy to achieve durable effects and complete response; 2) LNP-assisted
mRNA therapy can reprogram LAM-like cells back to a “normal” state without affecting normal tissue, and can
re-normalize LAM microenvironment; 3) multi-omic single cell analysis will reveal mechanism of action of mRNA
therapy and help improve LNP design. Our hypotheses will be tested in the following Aims:
Aim 1. To develop and optimize lung-specific synthetic lipid nanoparticles for LAM-targeted mRNA therapy.
Aim 2. To determine therapeutic efficacy of LAM-targeting nanoparticle-assisted mRNA therapy for LAM.
Aim 3. To determine mRNA therapy-induced LAM cell reprogramming and LAM microenvironment remodeling
by integrative single cell multiomic analyses.
The scientific and preclinical impact of this project are 1) development of LAM cell-targeted mRNA therapy;
2) proof-of-concept that mRNA therapy can achieve durable response; 3) molecular understanding of LAM cell
reprogramming and LAM microenvironment restoration by mRNA therapy. The success of this study will open
a new therapeutic paradigm of mRNA therapy with the potential of durable effects and complete remissions.",Develop lung-targeted synthetic lipid nanoparticles for mRNA medicine treating pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis,"Narrative

"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
 Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients make up 90-95% of all diagnosed diabetes mellitus and show
serious cognitive and mood deficits that are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, poor self-care,
and decreased life quality. These deficits are linked to brain tissue changes, potentially resulting from impaired
blood brain barrier (BBB) function. However, it is unclear whether BBB function can be repaired in T2DM
adults, reducing impaired cognition and mood functions and early risks of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.
The BBB restricts diffusion of microscopic objects (such as bacteria) and large (e.g., antibodies and many
drugs) or hydrophilic molecules (e.g., salt) from crossing into brain tissue and protects from harmful
substances. Although multiple methods, including positron emission tomography, single photon emission
computed tomography, and contrast-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can examine BBB function,
they are either invasive or pose significant health risks on humans. Using non-invasive MRI based diffusion-
weighted pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (DW-pCASL), BBB function status can be examined, which
has been validated to examine BBB breakdown in pre-clinical and in pilot T2DM studies. Several pre-clinical
studies suggest the possibility for BBB function repair, including low-cost thiamine intervention. Thiamine is an
essential component for carbohydrate metabolism and adequate or higher levels promote aerobic metabolism.
In addition, reduced thiamine levels are shown contributing to impaired endothelial cell functions, leading to
BBB dysfunction, and higher doses improve endothelial functions. Although the majority of T2DM adults show
thiamine deficiency that may contribute to impaired BBB function, but it is unclear if the thiamine treatment can
improve BBB function. Therefore, using 52 T2DM adults with randomized clinical trial, the specific aims are to:
1) compare BBB function, using DW-pCASL, and blood serum BBB (S100β levels) biomarkers in T2DM adults
with and without thiamine treatment and 2) examine cognition (Wide Range Assessment of Memory and
Learning 2 and Montreal Cognitive Assessment) and mood (Beck Depression Inventory II and Beck Anxiety
Inventory) between T2DM adults with thiamine treatment compared to T2DM adults without thiamine
treatment. In summary, low-cost thiamine treatment will be performed to assess whether impaired BBB
function and mood and cognition deficits are improved in T2DM adults. If successful, the information from this
clinical trial might serve as a novel and innovative treatment strategy to repair BBB function, affecting less
cognition and mood function, and hence better outcomes in T2DM adults. This R21 clinical trial study will
provide required data regarding the benefits of a low-cost thiamine intervention that could be implemented on a
large-scale clinical trial to repair BBB function, and thus, decrease early dementia and Alzheimer’s disease,
reduce morbidity and mortality, and increase quality of life in T2DM adults.",Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Blood Brain Barrier Function Improvement- A Randomized Clinical Trial,"PROJECT NARRATIVE

"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Type 2 diabetes is associated with derangements in a variety of pathways of intermediary metabolism. In
addition to the widely-known effects on glucose metabolism, diabetes is also associated with abnormalities in
lipid and amino acid metabolism including elevations in branched chain amino acids (BCAA). BCAAs are
increased in people with obesity and insulin resistance and high plasma BCAA concentrations are predictive of
future development of diabetes. Dietary restriction of BCAAs in rats improves insulin sensitivity and genome-
wide association studies in humans have demonstrated that genetic variations in enzymes controlling BCAA
metabolism are associated with increased BCAA concentrations and are also linked to the development of
insulin resistance. These data suggest that high BCAA concentrations play a causative role in the development
of insulin resistance and that strategies that correct accumulation of these bioactive amino acids may have
value as therapeutic avenues for treating diabetes. Circulating BCAA concentrations are regulated by dietary
intake, rates of protein synthesis and proteolysis, and BCAA catabolism. To be oxidized, BCAAs are first
reversibly converted to branched chain keto acids (BCKA) by branched chain aminotransferases. Next, BCKA
undergo oxidation that is catalyzed by the BCKA dehydrogenase (BCKDH) enzyme complex in the
mitochondrial matrix. BCKDH is regulated by inhibitory phosphorylation and is activated by a protein
phosphatase (PPM1K) that removes this covalent modification. Genetic or pharmacologic approaches to
reduce BCKDH phosphorylation lead to enhanced BCKA catabolism and improved insulin sensitivity in rodent
models of obesity. This application is designed to test the novel hypothesis that PPM1K phosphorylation at a
conserved serine residue suppresses the activity of this phosphatase leading to increased BCKDH
phosphorylation. Our studies are designed to identify mechanisms by which this phosphorylation is regulated,
define the effects of this covalent modification on intrinsic PPM1K activity, and determine the effects of PPM1K
phosphorylation on BCAA metabolism in liver of diabetic rodents.",Covalent regulation of branched chain amino acid metabolism,"PROJECT NARRATIVE

"Project Summary
Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a rare form of dementia that affects thousands of patients in the US and for
which there is no cure. FTD usually manifests with changes in personality, behavior or mood, memory loss,
confusion, and difficulty with day-to-day tasks. This symptomatology arises from neurodegeneration in the
frontal and temporal lobes, which are areas of the brain that control personality, emotions, behavior, and some
forms of cognition. One of the most common forms of FTD in the US is caused by mutations in Tau (sporadic
and genetic) causing Tau intracellular accumulation and aggregation, synaptic dysfunction, neuronal death,
and severe memory loss. Currently there are no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved therapies
for FTD, and there are no treatments that can stop or alter the course of disease progression. Therefore, there
is an unmet need for the development of therapeutic strategies that can improve the quality of life of patients
with FTD. We previously showed that the serine/threonine Protein kinase CK2 alpha prime (CK2α’) is a
pathological sensor activated in the presence of protein aggregation and synaptic dysfunction in different
human proteinopathies such as Huntington’s disease (HD) that contributes to neurodegeneration and
behavioral alterations. Our previous and preliminary data demonstrated that some forms of FTD present
similarities in the mechanisms that lead to neurodegeneration and behavioral deficits with HD. Our preliminary
data removing one allele of CK2α’ in the FTD PS19 mouse model expressing a Tau mutation (P301L)
associated with hereditary FTD restored the expression of glutamate related signaling (GRS) genes, increased
soluble Tau levels and rescued memory deficits assessed in the Barnes maze task. These results represent a
strong foundation for the pharmacological inhibition of CK2α’ as a potential therapeutic strategy for the
treatment of neurodegeneration and memory decline associated with FTD. In this proposal we will investigate
the therapeutic potential of the pharmacological inhibition of CK2α’ in the treatment of memory deficits
associated with FTD using the FDA approved CK2 inhibitor Silmitasertib (CX4945). CX4945 is currently in
clinical trials for the treatment of several cancers, is oral bioavailable and safe in humans, and if proven
efficacious in the amelioration of memory loss in FTD mice it could become a potential therapeutic strategy for
the treatment of FTD. We will treat two different groups of mice (pre-symptomatic and early symptomatic) and
will evaluate the impact of CX4945 in learning and memory by conducting three different behavioral tasks (Y
maze for spatial working memory, T-maze for spatial reference memory and Barnes maze for spatial learning
and memory). We will conduct RNA-seq analyses in the FC of mice to assess the impact of CX4945 on GRS
and other synaptic genes and its association with Tau/TauP levels and neuronal function using Ca2+ imaging
analyses. Successful completion of this study will consolidate the role of CK2α’ in FTD and will establish proof
of concept for the therapeutic potential of using CK2 inhibitors for the treatment of memory loss in FTD.",Assessment of the therapeutic potential of the anticancer agent Silmitasertib in the treatment of memory loss in Frontotemporal dementia,"Project Narrative

"The majority of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk is genetic and genome wide association studies (GWAS)
have identified 75 AD-associated SNPs. In other fields, pharmacologic agents targeting proteins identified
through genetics have produced striking success. However, the AD field has lagged, partly because we have
struggled to identify the molecular mechanisms whereby genetic variants impact AD. This proposal focuses on
the phospholipase PLCG2, which was initially associated with AD through a missense SNP, rs72824905
(P522R), that strikingly reduces AD risk. PLCG2 modulates microglial function by mediating signaling from
TREM2 and related receptors. P522R appears a hypermorphic mutation that increases PLCG2 function
through an unclear mechanism. However, homozygosity for P522R is apparently deleterious, suggesting that
PLCG2 activity must be tightly controlled for optimal brain aging. In considering PLCG2 genetics and AD, we
recognized that PLCG2 expression and splicing relative to AD genetics have not been scrutinized. Indeed, a
SNP upstream of PLCG2, rs12446759, was recently associated with AD risk in a GWAS; the actions of this
GWAS SNP are not clear although eQTL compendia suggest that this SNP is associated with expression of
the lncRNA RP11-960L18, some isoforms of which include PLCG2 beginning at exon 2. To address the gap
in our knowledge regarding PLCG2 expression and AD genetics, we propose to elucidate the extent that
genetics modulate PLCG2 expression and splicing, to identify the underlying mechanisms, and to identify
proof-of-concept approaches to improve PLCG2 expression to reduce AD risk. In preliminary work, we
identified a novel PLCG2 splice variant, D65-PLCG2, in human brain, quantified this isoform in AD and non-AD
brain samples, and identified a SNP, rs1071644, within the variant exon that correlates with expression of this
novel isoform. Remarkably, rs1071644 is associated with increased AD risk (p=9x10-8). Rs1071644 appears
to be a novel AD risk factor because this SNP is not co-inherited with either the GWAS SNP, rs12446759 or
P522R according to LDpair. In summary, our global hypothesis is that genetic variants impact PLCG2 splicing
and/or expression to alter PLCG2 function and thereby modulate AD risk. To explore this hypothesis, we
propose these Specific Aims: 1: Identify and quantify PLCG2 isoforms expressed in human brain as a
function of AD neuropathology and genetics. 2: Compare PLCG2 and D65-PLCG2 protein expression
and function. 3: Translate PLCG2 splicing genetics to identify modulators predicted to reduce AD risk.
Successful completion of these studies will reveal rs1071644 as a novel AD risk factor that acts via PLCG2
splicing, show that the AD GWAS SNP rs12446759 alters expression of a novel RP11-960L18_PLCG2
isoform, test whether the D65-PLCG2 represents a gain or loss of function, and begin to translate these
findings to pharmacologic modulation. By defining the extent that genetics regulate PLCG2 expression to alter
AD risk, these results will inform drug development targeting this pathway.",Deciphering genetics of PLCG2 alternative splicing to understand AD risk,"We have identified a novel PLCG2 splice variant that is increased in human brain by a polymorphism that is

that improve PLCG2 splicing to reduce AD risk. Overall, this proposal will provide quantitative insights into
PLCG2 expression relative to AD risk, test the role of splicing in PLCG2, and begin to translate our findings

"Aging is the greatest single risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related diseases (ADRD). A
diagnosis of AD/ADRD reflects the progressive loss of memory, speech processing and visual/spatial abilities
as the brain deteriorates. People with AD/ADRD lose independence, and the loss of neurons leads to death as
the brain loses the ability to regulate bodily functions. Treatment options for people diagnosed with AD/ADRD
are limited and can have serious side effects. This is a significant problem, as lower rates of births and higher
life expectancy continues to transform the age structure of the US population, increasing the proportion of people
with advanced age (>65yr) and the number of people being diagnosed with AD/ADRD. The small, secreted
peptide adropin is a new lead for developing treatments for neurodegenerative conditions underlying dementia.
In adults aged 70 years or older, low circulating adropin concentrations associate with accelerated cognitive
decline. While the source of circulating adropin is not known, it is very highly expressed in the human nervous
system. Adropin expression in brain tissues shows strong, positive correlations with gene networks that are
involved in mitochondrial and neuronal functions, suggesting a link between adropin and how the brain uses
energy. Preclinical studies using mouse models suggest that reversing a decline in adropin expression with
natural aging delays or prevents mild cognitive impairment. This proposal address two critical gaps in knowledge.
First, whether low adropin levels are sufficient to accelerate cognitive decline is not known. Second, whether the
peptide is effective in severe mouse models of neurodegeneration has not been studied. AIM 1 determines
whether low adropin expression accelerates aging-related cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Cognitive
functions of adropin-deficient mice will be compared to wild-type controls up to 18 months of age (corresponding
to a human age of
56-69 years) using tests of spatial learning and memory. Biochemical signatures of
inflammation, mitochondrial and synaptic dysfunctions will also be assessed. AIM 2 determines whether
administration of synthetic adropin peptide to SAMP8 mice prevents or reverses cognitive impairment. SAMP8
mice exhibit many of the brain pathologies considered as ‘classical’ age-related and develop severe brain
inflammation, cognitive deficits, and behavioral changes around 12 months of age. The hypothesis that adropin
will improve cognition in this model of accelerated neurodegeneration is supported by strong preliminary data
showing reversal of cognitive impairment in 12-month-old SAMP8 mice treated for 2 weeks with the peptide. The
impact of treatment on neurochemical signatures of inflammation, mitochondrial and synaptic functions will also
be assessed. The results from these experiments will provide critical preclinical data that will inform future studies
of the role of this novel, important neuropeptide in risk of disease onset and treatment for dementia.",An investigation of the response of preclinical mouse models of dementia to adropin therapy,"The underlying causes and treatment of dementias observed with advanced age remain poorly understood and

"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The respiratory microbiome was reported for the first time in 2010. Since then, various studies have shown that
the microorganisms in the respiratory tract influence respiratory health, as changes in the respiratory microbiome
have been associated with airway inflammation and various respiratory diseases, like asthma and allergic rhinitis.
While studies have reported dysbiosis of the microbiome with exposure to general pollutants like particulate
matter, the impact of climate change-dependent pollutants like wood smoke is currently unknown yet is likely to
have significant health implications. As wood smoke exposure events are growing worldwide due to wildfires, it
is critical that we learn more about the respiratory response to this exposure. Therefore, the overall objective of
this proposal is to characterize the structural and functional changes of the respiratory microbiota and its
metabolome after wood smoke exposure and identify the mechanism(s) by which the respiratory microbiota and
its metabolome modulate the host response to this exposure. The central hypothesis of this project is that the
respiratory microbiome is a significant component of the host response to wood smoke via metabolite-driven
host-microbiome interactions. Therefore, my specific aims will first (Aim 1) characterize the in vivo effects of
wood smoke on the respiratory microbiota and metabolome individually, followed by an innovative multi-omics
approach that integrates respiratory microbiome and metabolomics data to determine interactions. My second
aim (Aim 2) focuses on identifying the microbe-derived metabolites and metabolite-driven mechanisms that
modulate the host response to wood smoke. Here, I will study the in vitro effect of this exposure on the individual
components of host-microbiota interactions and their metabolite-driven crosstalk. The results of this proposal will
be significant as they will demonstrate for the first time that the respiratory microbiota has an active role in the
host response to wood smoke via metabolites, highlighting the importance of considering the respiratory
microbiome in inhalational toxicology. Furthermore, these results will identify microorganisms and
microorganism-derived metabolites with potential therapeutic and prophylactic properties against wood smoke-
induced respiratory adverse health effects. Notably, this project will provide multiple training opportunities in
microbiome analysis, metabolomics, and advanced computational analyses, such as multi-omics data
integration and machine learning, significantly advancing my goal to become an independent scientist.",The respiratory microbiome and its role in the host response to wood smoke,"PROJECT NARRATIVE

"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the second most common presenile dementia after Alzheimer’s disease and
shares many pathological and genetic overlaps with ALS. The most common genetic cause of FTD and ALS is
a GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the first intron of the C9ORF72 gene. Although RNA toxicity
and C9ORF72 haploinsufficiency may also contribute to disease pathogenesis in C9ORF72-related FTD/ALS,
much efforts has focused on investigating the toxicity of dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins that can be translated
from both sense and antisense repeat RNAs. How these DPR proteins, especially poly(GR), cause
neurodegeneration at the molecular mechanistic level remains largely unknown. In this exploratory R21 grant
application, based on our recent findings that several antimicrobial peptide genes, such as metchnikowin (Mtk),
are upregulated with poly(GR) toxicity in Drosophila and that Mtk knockdown in the eye or in all neurons
suppresses poly(GR) neurotoxicity, we propose to further investigate this understudied pathway in
neurodegeneration. In particular, we will investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of Mtk on
poly(GR) toxicity, explore the non-cell autonomous neurodegenerative activity of Mtk, and finally attempt to
identify mammalian AMP(s) that may function in a similar fashion as Drosophila Mtk in the molecular
pathogenesis of FTD/ALS. These studiers will shed new light on pathogenic mechanisms of FTD/ALS and may
help identify novel therapeutic targets for these disorders.",Mechanistic Investigation of Innate Immunity in a Drosophila Model of Frontotemporal Dementia,"Narrative

"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Myeloid cells are one of the most abundant immune infiltrates in the glioblastoma (GBM) tumor microenvironment
(TME); they can constitute 20-30% of the tumor mass and are either of hematopoietic origin or are tissue-
resident. Myeloid cells play a crucial role in shaping the TME, promoting tumor growth, regulating adaptive
immunity, and in response to therapy. Due to these significant roles, myeloid cells are an essential subject of
intensive research and therapeutic target development. However, targeting tumor-associated myeloid cells has
been remarkably challenging. One of the critical factors underlying this difficulty is our incomplete understanding
of their heterogeneity and of the interactions between various myeloid subsets. This application is focused on
myeloid subsets, referred to as monocytes and neutrophils, which infiltrate tumors from the blood circulation and
differentiate into tumor-associated macrophages and tumor-associated neutrophils. We provide evidence that
both populations infiltrate GBM, but that their composition differs; while monocytes are enriched in Proneural
and Classical GBM, Mesenchymal GBM shows increased neutrophils in addition to increased microglia
presence. Using genetically-engineered mouse models driven by human GBM-specific driver mutations, we
discovered that tumor growth was not impaired when the influx of monocytes was abolished in murine Proneural
monocyte-enriched GBM due to compensatory recruitment of neutrophils, which resulted in PN-> MES transition
of tumors. We hypothesize that although monocyte and neutrophil infiltration differ in various GBM subtypes,
they share many common tumor-promoting and immunosuppressive functions. Thus, targeting one population
will lead to infiltration of the other, but targeting both will lead to impaired tumor growth, increased activation of
T-cells, and improved immune surveillance. To address our hypothesis, we will: (1) determine how the spatial
and genetic heterogeneity of GBM affects myeloid infiltration and expression profiles using single-cell RNA-
sequencing, spatial multiomics, and multiplex FACS with a major focus on neutrophils in the presence and
absence of monocyte infiltration. We will functionally characterize myeloid subsets, test their immunosuppressive
properties, and identify how TNFα signaling and/or other neutrophil-driven gliomagens regulate neutrophil-tumor
crosstalk to promote GBM growth in the presence or absence of monocytes; and (2) determine the biological
significance on GBM tumor growth and immunity when infiltration of both myeloid subsets from blood is
abolished. These studies have the potential to help us to understand better the remaining challenges of
macrophage- and chemokine-targeted therapies in cancer. We will also determine the therapeutic efficacy of
two small-molecule inhibitors targeting monocytes and neutrophil influx into tumors.",Myeloid Recruitments and their Role in Brain Tumors,"Narrative (public health relevance statement):
The grim prognosis and lack of therapeutic options for glioblastoma highlight the urgency of working towards
developing novel treatment modalities. Myeloid-targeted therapies have been ineffective despite intensive
research. This application will provide the unique opportunity to explore myeloid heterogeneity, the mechanisms
driving their influx into tumors, and what drives current anti-myeloid targeted therapy resistance.",https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10905606,Address;Affect;Automobile Driving;Binding;Biological;Biological Assay;Blood;Blood Circulation;Bone Marrow;Brain;Brain Neoplasms;CXCL1 gene;Cell Communication;Cell Physiology;Cells;Chemotaxis;Chemotaxis Induction;Circulation;Clinical;Coculture Techniques;Common Neoplasm;Complement;Data;Development;Dominant Genes;Endothelial Cells;Flow Cytometry;Foundations;Gene Expression;Genetic;Genetic Heterogeneity;Genetic Transcription;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genotype;Glioblastoma;Goals;Growth;Hematopoietic;Heterogeneity;Human;IL8RB gene;Immunologic Surveillance;Immunosuppression;Impairment;In Vitro;Infiltration;Innate Immune System;Knowledge;Longevity;Macrophage;Malignant Neoplasms;Mesenchymal;Methods;Microglia;Modality;Modeling;Mus;Myelogenous;Myeloid Cells;NF1 gene;Necrosis;Necrosis Induction;Neutrophil Infiltration;PDGFB gene;Play;Population;Production;Prognosis;Property;Research;Resistance;Role;Shapes;Signal Transduction;Slice;T-Cell Activation;T-Lymphocyte;TNF gene;TNFRSF1A gene;Testing;The Cancer Genome Atlas;Therapeutic;Tissues;Treatment Efficacy;Tumor Immunity;Tumor Promotion;Tumor Tissue;Tumor-associated macrophages;Validation;adaptive immunity;cancer therapy;cell type;chemokine;comparison control;design;driver mutation;genetic signature;immune cell infiltrate;improved;in vivo;migration;molecular subtypes;monocyte;mouse model;multiple omics;neglect;neutrophil;novel;pharmacologic;public health relevance;recruit;resistance mechanism;single-cell RNA sequencing;small molecule inhibitor;spatiotemporal;targeted treatment;therapeutic target;trafficking;treatment response;tumor;tumor growth;tumor microenvironment;tumor progression;tumor-immune system interactions,10905606,1R01NS137631-01,glioblastoma,6,0.89,0.94,tru,,"myeloid cells are one of the most abundant immune infiltrates in the glioblastoma (gbm) tumor microenvironment

"ABSTRACT
Codomax has developed the Epi-MAX platform, an integrated mass spectrometry omics and computational
technology for enhanced protein synthesis. Current protein manufacturing processes typically employ
expression vectors inserted into heterologous host cells, where gene, regulatory and cell features limit protein
production; some proteins are difficult to express in high yields due to inefficiently translated or sub-optimally
transcribed mRNA. Codomax's innovation hinges on the discovery that cells regulate translation in response to
stress by altering the tRNA pools to enhance translation of mRNAs with distinct codon usage patterns. The Epi-
MAX platform has leveraged this tRNA codon-based mechanism to increase recombinant protein expression in
cells by matching codon usage in the target gene to the stress-reprogrammed tRNAs. Previously, Codomax
demonstrated stress-induced tRNA reprogramming in mammalian systems and propose to extend the platform
to antibody production in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Underlying antibody production in CHO cells is
the stress of high protein expression, evidenced by Codomax's observed changes in the levels of mRNAs and
proteins specific to stress response, protein folding and metabolic genes when comparing high to low expressing
clones. High antibody expression reprograms protein expression machinery with dramatic changes in ribosome
components and translation factors. Codomax has shown that available levels of the CREB1 transcription factor,
which drives target antibody expression, decrease in high expressing clones. Thus, the specific aims for
Codomax's project include application of the Epi-MAX platform to analyze high and low productivity CHO clones
for the model therapeutic antibody to identify tRNA systems that limit heavy chain production, and then identify
tRNAs that when over-expressed, boost antibody expression (Aim 1). Codomax will then increase target heavy
and light chain mRNA transcription 200%, by re-engineering the CMV-regulating CREB1 transcription factor to
have increased stress-induced translation (Aim 2). Codon optimized CREB1 will be used to enhance mRNA
translation during the stress of antibody expression, with maximized CREB1 transcription factor levels driving
increased mRNA transcription from the CMV promoter. The CREB1 gene will be re-engineered using Epi-MAX
data from Aim 1. Then CRISPR-Cas9 approaches will be used to replace the native CREB1 gene with the
CREB1-codon optimized sequence and mRNA expression will be evaluated for the heavy and light chains under
high expression conditions. Aim 2 will result in the generation of gene sequences, plasmids and CRISPR
reagents for CMV-based transcription in several CHO lines. The successful completion of Codomax's Phase I
project will demonstrate proof-of-concept that the Epi-MAX platform can be used to increase antibody yield from
CHO cells and generate designer reagents that promote boosted antibody production.",Optimizing Antibody Production in CHO Cells Using Epi-MAX Technology to Increase Heavy and Light Chain Expression,"NARRATIVE
Achieving robust protein expression is a pain point for customers in the biomanufacturing industry, as candidate
proteins may be abandoned at the development phase due to low expression levels which limit commercial
viability. Codomax has developed the Epi-MAX platform, a cell and codon engineering platform for enhanced
protein synthesis. Here we propose to use our Epi-MAX technology to assess tRNA-centric changes in
translation that occur during high protein expression and to re-engineer CHO cells for optimized translation of
mRNA for target antibodies of interest.",https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10921744,Antibodies;Antibody Formation;Antibody titer measurement;Automobile Driving;Biomanufacturing;Bispecific Antibodies;CREB1 gene;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cells;Chinese Hamster;Chinese Hamster Ovary Cell;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Codon Nucleotides;Computer software;Coupled;Cytomegalovirus;Data;Development;Engineering;Enhancement Technology;Escherichia coli;Foundations;Gene Expression;Generations;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Genome;Heat shock proteins;Human;Industry;Light;Link;Liver;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Messenger RNA;Metabolic;Modeling;Modification;Mus;Organ;Organism;Ovary;Pain;Pattern;Phase;Pichia;Pilot Projects;Plasmids;Production;Productivity;Protein Biosynthesis;Proteins;Proteome;Rattus;Reagent;Recombinant Proteins;Ribosomes;Sampling;Small Business Technology Transfer Research;Stress;System;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic antibodies;Time;Transfer RNA;Translating;Translations;biological adaptation to stress;commercialization;expression vector;innovation;interest;mRNA Expression;mRNA Translation;manufacturing process;overexpression;programs;promoter;protein expression;protein folding;response;transcription factor;transcriptome sequencing;translation factor,10921744,1R41TR005122-01,,,,,,,,"['antibodies', 'antibody formation', 'antibody titer measurement', 'automobile driving', 'biomanufacturing', 'bispecific antibodies', 'creb1 gene', 'crispr/cas technology', 'cells', 'chinese hamster', 'chinese hamster ovary cell', 'clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats', 'codon nucleotides', 'computer software', 'coupled', 'cytomegalovirus', 'data', 'development', 'engineering', 'enhancement technology', 'escherichia coli', 'foundations', 'gene expression', 'generations', 'genes', 'genetic transcription', 'genome', 'heat shock proteins', 'human', 'industry', 'light', 'link', 'liver', 'mass spectrum analysis', 'messenger rna', 'metabolic', 'modeling', 'modification', 'mus', 'organ', 'organism', 'ovary', 'pain', 'pattern', 'phase', 'pichia', 'pilot projects', 'plasmids', 'production', 'productivity', 'protein biosynthesis', 'proteins', 'proteome', 'rattus', 'reagent', 'recombinant proteins', 'ribosomes', 'sampling', 'small business technology transfer research', 'stress', 'system', 'technology', 'testing', 'therapeutic antibodies', 'time', 'transfer rna', 'translating', 'translations', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'commercialization', 'expression vector', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mrna expression', 'mrna translation', 'manufacturing process', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'promoter', 'protein expression', 'protein folding', 'response', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'translation factor']",,
"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal is for the purchase of a 4-laser Amnis ImageStream MK II imaging flow cytometer for placement
in the UMass Chan Medical School (UMCMS) Flow Cytometry Research Core Facility, a robust and well-
established facility serving over 120 principal investigators each year. The Flow Core currently utilizes a 3-laser
Amnis FlowSight imaging flow cytometer that is 11 years old and, with only 20 X magnification, lacks the
resolution to meet the imaging needs of our researchers. Many of the Major and Minor users supporting this
proposal currently rely on cumbersome microscopy techniques because they could not obtain sufficient
resolution on our FlowSight to utilize imaging flow cytometry for applications such as cell-cell interactions,
subcellular localization, DNA repair foci, phagocytosis, and complex morphological changes like NETosis. The
4-laser Amnis ImageStream with 20/40/60 X magnification will have greatly improved capabilities, increased
sensitivity, resolution, and reproducibility of single-cell imaging. Coupled with the new Machine Learning
software, the ImageStream will greatly increase our researchers’ rate of data acquisition as well as speed of
data analysis, while offering verifiable, objective, reproducible data, and statistical analyses.
The UMCMS Flow Core has been faced with the urgent need to replace a large amount of aging but essential
equipment within a short time, as many of our instruments have been made obsolete by the manufacturer.
Recognizing that institutional funds are limiting, this proposal for a Shared Instrumentation Grant is an
essential part of our equipment replacement plan. Our researchers that depend on the Flow Core instruments
come from over 20 different departments and over 90% of them are NIH-funded. These investigators have
helped to make UMMS a world-leader in translational research, coupling basic biomedical research to a bench-
to-bedside innovation engine. UMMS researchers have made pivotal advances in HIV, cancer, diabetes,
autoimmunity, infectious disease, gene therapy and in understanding the molecular basis of disease. The Flow
Core has been central to many of these advances. This Amnis ImageStream MK II imaging flow cytometer will
support new research applications that could not be imaged on our FlowSight, providing state-of-the-art cell
analyses for our dynamic, growing pool of NIH-funded researchers. The research projects of our 12 Major and

whose loss correlates with seizure frequency. Test whether loss of reelin interneurons in the dentate gyrus
occurs in a large animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Test whether reelin-positive interneurons are total
molecular layer cells. Measure the strength of synaptic output of reelin interneurons. And test whether loss of
reelin causes seizures. To achieve these goals animal models will be evaluated: pilocarpine-treated rats and
sea lions with naturally occurring temporal lobe epilepsy. Methods employed will include continuous telemetric

within this research proposal, in partnership with minority serving schools, we will create two
pathways to address the disparity in the oncology workforce, including translational research. We
will address these gaps in the field by pursuing the following specific aims: In Aim 1, we will
determine spatial gene expression differences Black vs. White patients with HPV-negative OPC.
In Aim 2, we will integrate spatial genomics and AI-guided pathomics between high vs. low
pathomic expression within tissue types, controlling for self-reported race and genetically
determined ancestry. To address the gap in URM in the oncology workforce, in Aim 3 we will
work in partnership with City of Medicine Academy and Howard University to provide a
longitudinal oncology research experience for high school students and surgical residents. In Aim
4, we will provide a laboratory incubator space in which URM Duke Faculty will be embedded to
pursue cancer research, along with mentoring from experienced and committed mentors.
 We propose to address these important issues and lack of reliable biomarkers for all

compared to HPV-negative OPC. Therefore, we will identify differences in gene expression and
stromal and immune cell topology between Black and White patients to identify biologic
mechanism(s) that underlies racial disparities with respect to oncologic outcomes. Moreover,
within this research proposal, in partnership with minority serving schools, we will create two
pathways to address the disparity in the oncology workforce, including translational research. We
will address these gaps in the field by pursuing the following specific aims: In Aim 1, we will
determine spatial gene expression differences Black vs. White patients with HPV-negative OPC.
In Aim 2, we will integrate spatial genomics and AI-guided pathomics between high vs. low
pathomic expression within tissue types, controlling for self-reported race. To address the gap in
URM in the oncology workforce, in Aim 3 we will work in partnership with City of Medicine
Academy and Howard University to provide a longitudinal oncology research experience for high
school students and surgical residents. In Aim 4, we will provide a laboratory incubator space in
which URM Duke Faculty will be embedded to pursue cancer research, along with mentoring from
experienced and committed mentors.
 We propose to address these important issues and lack of reliable biomarkers for all
patients by integrating state-of-the-art techniques in genomics, pathomics, and AI, in a setting
fostering diversity and inclusion. The data generated will be of benefit to all patients with HPV-
negative OPCs as we are presently unable to identify poor responders regardless of race.",https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10857990,"Academy;Address;Agreement;Appearance;Artificial Intelligence;Asian;Behavior;Biological;Biological Factors;Biological Markers;Black race;Cancer Biology;Cancer Relapse;Caring;Cells;Cities;County;Data;Development;Discrimination;Disease;Disparate;Disparity;Elements;Environment;Ethnic Origin;Faculty;Fostering;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profiling;Genes;Genetic;Genomics;Genotype;HPV oropharyngeal cancer;Head and Neck Cancer;Health;Health system;High School Student;Hispanic;Human Papillomavirus;Immune;Incubators;Laboratories;Latino;Latinx;Malignant Neoplasms;Medical;Medicine;Mentors;Minority;Minority-Serving Institution;Molecular;Monitor;Oncology;Operative Surgical Procedures;Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma;Outcome;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patient Self-Report;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Phenotype;Physicians;Prediction of Response to Therapy;Quality of Care;Race;Radiation Oncology;Recording of previous events;Recurrence;Reporting;Research;Research Proposals;Resolution;Schools;Science;Social Controls;Stromal Cells;Surveys;Techniques;Tissue-Specific Gene Expression;Tissues;Training;Translational Research;Treatment Failure;Underrepresented Minority;Universities;Woman;Work;anti-cancer research;black patient;cancer health disparity;career;chemoradiation;college;diagnostic strategy;differential expression;diversity and inclusion;equity, diversity, and inclusion;experience;high school;improved;innovation;malignant oropharynx neoplasm;marginalized community;medical schools;mortality;mortality risk;neoplastic;new technology;next generation;novel diagnostics;programs;racial bias;racial disparity;radiation resistance;response;risk stratification;social;socioeconomics;spatial integration;survival disparity;transcriptomic profiling;transcriptomics;treatment effect;treatment response",10857990,1R01DE033740-01,,,,,,,,"['academy', 'address', 'agreement', 'appearance', 'artificial intelligence', 'asian', 'behavior', 'biological', 'biological factors', 'biological markers', 'black race', 'cancer biology', 'cancer relapse', 'caring', 'cells', 'cities', 'county', 'data', 'development', 'discrimination', 'disease', 'disparate', 'disparity', 'elements', 'environment', 'ethnic origin', 'faculty', 'fostering', 'gene expression', 'gene expression profiling', 'genes', 'genetic', 'genomics', 'genotype', 'hpv oropharyngeal cancer', 'head and neck cancer', 'health', 'health system', 'high school student', 'hispanic', 'human papillomavirus', 'immune', 'incubators', 'laboratories', 'latino', 'latinx', 'malignant neoplasms', 'medical', 'medicine', 'mentors', 'minority', 'minority-serving institution', 'molecular', 'monitor', 'oncology', 'operative surgical procedures', 'oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma', 'outcome', 'pathogenesis', 'pathway interactions', 'patient self-report', 'patient-focused outcomes', 'patients', 'phenotype', 'physicians', 'prediction of response to therapy', 'quality of care', 'race', 'radiation oncology', 'recording of previous events', 'recurrence', 'reporting', 'research', 'research proposals', 'resolution', 'schools', 'science', 'social controls', 'stromal cells', 'surveys', 'techniques', 'tissue-specific gene expression', 'tissues', 'training', 'translational research', 'treatment failure', 'underrepresented minority', 'universities', 'woman', 'work', 'anti-cancer research', 'black patient', 'cancer health disparity', 'career', 'chemoradiation', 'college', 'diagnostic strategy', 'differential expression', 'diversity and inclusion', 'equity, diversity, and inclusion', 'experience', 'high school', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'marginalized community', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'neoplastic', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel diagnostics', 'programs', 'racial bias', 'racial disparity', 'radiation resistance', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'spatial integration', 'survival disparity', 'transcriptomic profiling', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",,
"Acute kidney injury is diagnosed in over 50% of patients with sepsis. Sepsis-associated AKI

"Project Summary/Abstract
Dental caries is one of the most significant public health challenges in Alaska Native
communities. Added sugars from fruit drinks, especially Kool-Aid, are the main behavioral
risk factor for caries. Our team developed and implemented a community-based
intervention targeting sugared fruit drinks in Alaska Native children (NIDCR Grant No.
U01DE027629). The six-month intervention consisted of health education delivered by a
trained indigenous Community Health Worker, who taught families about the harms
caused by sugared fruit drinks, introduced sugar-free alternatives, and provided parents
with self-efficacy training to facilitate the switch. Local stores were recruited to sell sugar-
free Kool-Aid. We enrolled 201 Alaska Native children ages 1 to 10 years; 143 children in
two communities received the intervention and 58 children a third community were in the
delayed treatment control group. The trial ended in March 2023. Our team is currently
evaluating the intervention. The main trial outcome is change in added sugar intake from
baseline to 6m, measured using a validated hair biomarker. The trial did not include a
disease outcome, but we collected supragingival plaque samples from children
throughout the trial (baseline, 1m, 3m, 6m) and archived them for future study. We now
have tribal permissions to analyze the plaque. The goal of this 2-year R03 is to process
and analyze the 594 banked plaque samples. The Aims are to: (1) Assess the relationship
between added sugar intake and the oral microbiome in Alaska Native children; and (2)
Conduct mediator analyses to examine the effects of the intervention on the microbiome
with added sugar as the mediator. We will test the primary hypothesis that lower added
sugar intake is associated with increased alpha diversity, which is a signature of a healthy
microbiome. The proposed work will be the first known study to evaluate how added sugar
impacts the microbiome in Alaska Native children and is expected to provide insight on
mechanisms of the original behavioral trial. The knowledge gained will be critical in
refining future interventions aimed at reducing added sugar intake, preventing caries, and
addressing oral health inequities that disproportionately affect Indigenous communities.",Microbiome Analysis of Plaque Samples from a Community-Based Socio-behavioral RCT to Reduce Sugared Fruit Drinks in Alaska Native Children,"Project Narrative

"PROJECT SUMMARY
Misfolding and aggregation of mutant huntingtin exon1 (mHTTex1) promotes neurodegeneration in Huntington’s
disease (HD). The intrinsically disordered mHTTex1 misfolds into a heterogeneous mixture of assemblies,
however, how they form, and which conformers mediate neurotoxicity in vivo remain to be identified. This gap in
knowledge is due to a lack of molecular diagnostic tools to study the oligomerization pathway of native mHTTex1
in live neurons and to determine how it may induce neurodegeneration. Conformer-specific nanobodies will
enable us to perform these studies. Nanobodies are genetically encoded variable heavy domains (VHH), which
are naturally produced by camelids and sharks and display potent specificity towards target antigens. This project
will combine the experience of Dr. Langen’s lab in generating defined and stable helical oligomers and protofibrils
of recombinant mHTTex1, with the that of Dr. Khoshnan’s lab in nanobody technology and its application to
studies on the neurobiology of mHTTex1. We recently reported that among the various assemblies of
recombinant mHTTex1, protofibrils and their precursors helical oligomers are neuroinvasive since they can
penetrate human neurons, propagate, and induce nuclear damage. Towards identifying similar conformers in
vivo, we now have isolated llama nanobodies, which bind to helical oligomers, and protofibrils of recombinant
mHTTex1. We plan to investigate the binding properties of these nanobodies and develop diagnostic tools like
chromobodies by fusing them to GFP or RFP. These biosensors will be used to study the early steps of native
mHTTex1 oligomerization in live human neuronal stem-cell derived neurons, and examine whether helical
oligomers and/or protofibrils are neurotoxic. Nanobodies, which may inhibit the oligomerization of mHTTex1, will
be tested for ability to prevent aggregation and toxicity in the same model. This project has the potential to make
a significant contribution to our understanding of mHTTex1 oligomerization and neurotoxicity in a physiologically
relevant model, identify therapeutic modalities, and provide a set of novel molecular diagnostic tools for the
broader HD research community.",Developing novel nanobody-based biosensors and therapeutics for Huntington’s Disease,"NARRATIVE

"1 Particulate matter emitted through incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and biomass, known as combustion-
 2 emitted particulate matter (CE-PM), has emerged as a critical public health and climate change issue in the
 3 United States (US) and world-wide. Despite the implementation of The Clean Air Act in the 1970s, which led to
 4 a persistent reduction in ambient PM2.5 levels in the US, racial-ethnic disparities in PM exposure remain
 5 significant. People of color (POC), on average, experience disproportionate exposure to ambient PM2.5, with
 6 Black Americans experiencing the highest levels of PM2.5 exposure both nation-wide (by 34% higher than White
 7 Americans) and in most states. Moreover, the majority (>75%) of PM2.5 that POC breathe is from emission
 8 sources disproportionately affecting POC. This pattern is consistent across exposure levels, even in POC with
 9 optimal social determinants of health status (SDOH). The literature also reports that Black Americans reside
10 near emission sources such as traffic and industry due to a legacy of racist housing policies, and thus may be
11 exposed to more toxic PM, i.e., fresh combustion particles. A significant knowledge gap remains regarding
12 whether racial-ethnic disparity in ambient PM2.5 exposure can translate to higher lung deposition dose of black
13 carbon in Black versus White Americans and whether Black Americans are exposed to PM with stronger pro-
14 inflammatory potency than White Americans. We hypothesized that not only do Black Americans have higher
15 PM exposure, but that they are also exposed to more toxic PM due to the proximity of their neighborhoods to
16 traffic and industry. Macrophage carbon load (MaCL) is a novel sputum cytology-based method that quantifies
17 black carbon particles engulfed by the macrophages and reflects the lung dose of total CE-PM exposure at an
18 individual level over the past several months. We have successfully developed an innovative Machine-Learning
19 algorithm for Engulfed cArbon Particles (MacLEAP) that automates the scoring process of MaCL assay, and is
20 validated, high-throughput, and scorer-independent. This application will utilize biospecimens (sputum and blood)
21 from the Subpopulations and Intermediate Markers in COPD Study (SPIROMICS), a NHLBI-funded
22 observational study, which enrolled a geographically diverse cohort consisting predominantly of Black and White
23 Americans. We have identified 139 Black and White Americans each that are frequency-matched by age (± 10
24 years), sex (male and female), and stratum (non-smokers, smokers without airflow obstruction, smokers with
25 mild/moderate COPD, and smokers with severe COPD). Specific Aim 1 will assess whether Black Americans
26 have higher lung deposition dose of black carbon compared to White Americans using MaCL assay. Specific
27 Aim 2 will compare pro-inflammatory potency of PM exposures between Black and White Americans based on
28 slopes of the dose-response relationship between MaCL and pulmonary and systemic inflammation. Successful
29 completion of this study will greatly advance our understanding of racial-ethnic disparities in PM exposure and

"PROJECT ABSTRACT / SUMMARY
There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of outcomes related to third-line treatments
[onabotulinumtoxinA, peripheral tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS), and sacral neuromodulation] for refractory
overactive bladder (OAB) in older and frail older adults, who collectively comprise the majority of patients
suffering from this condition. Despite being well-studied in young and middle-aged healthy adults, little is
known about outcomes and complications of these treatments in these more vulnerable populations, potentially
resulting in overutilization of treatments that are ineffective or dangerous, or in underutilization of treatments
that may significantly improve health related quality of life. Our overarching research objective is to improve
care for all older and frail older adults undergoing treatment for OAB. The objective of this proposed study is to
better understand the utilization, outcomes and complications associated with onabotulinumtoxinA, PTNS, and
sacral neuromodulation in older and frail older adults, and to use this information to create an individualized
and actionable prognostic tool. The central hypothesis is that utilization of these procedures may be biased
towards younger aged individuals (of white race and higher socioeconomic status, performed by high volume
specialists), regardless of level of frailty, but that frailty will be highly correlated with poor outcomes and
increased rates of complications. We will test this hypothesis by leveraging a 100% cohort of fee-for-service
Medicare beneficiaries undergoing these procedures and the claims based frailty index (CFI), as the measure
of frailty, by the following three aims: (1) to understand the utilization of invasive OAB treatments (a) according
to age and frailty, and (b) according to other non-clinical factors: patient (race/ethnicity), regional
(socioeconomic) and provider (surgeon and volume); (2) to determine downstream outcomes and utilization of
third-line OAB treatments across the spectrum of advancing age and frailty up to 2 years after the procedure;
(3) to develop and internally validate a prognostic tool to predict successful outcomes for older and frail older
adults undergoing third-line OAB treatments. This study is innovative because it will measure and apply the
important factor of frailty to a national cohort of 100% of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries undergoing
onabotulinumtoxinA, PTNS, and sacral neuromodulation to ultimately create an individualized prognostic tool
to improve outcomes in this understudied population. The proposed research is significant because there is a
critical lack of information about outcomes for refractory OAB in this large and vulnerable population who suffer
greatly from this condition. Development of an individualized prognostic tool to aid in this decision-making
process will serve to minimize the risks of potentially unsuccessful, unnecessary and even harmful procedures,
while promoting the use of such procedures among individuals who are more likely to receive benefit.",Risk determination and prognostication for older and frail older adults undergoing advanced treatments for overactive bladder,"PROJECT NARRATIVE

from one eye that in normal mice results in strengthening of cortical responses to stimulation of the nondeprived
eye. Ts1Rhr mice harbor a smaller duplication and demonstrate similar plasticity impairment. Within the Ts1Rhr
duplication, preliminary data indicate that the gene encoding Dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated
kinase 1a (DYRK1A) drives impairment when trisomic and this impairment can be rescued by restoration of
Dyrk1a disomy. Dyrk1a haploinsufficiency also impairs ODP, suggesting that too little DYRK1A activity can be
as deleterious as too much activity; identifying DYRK1A effectors may provide additional, potentially safer, drug
targets as well as reveal the underlying mechanism of DYRK1A-driven impairment. In vitro studies have impli-
cated DYRK1A in hippocampal plasticity impairment and in behavioral phenotypes, though the mechanisms
underlying these phenotypes are not well understood. The central hypothesis is that Dyrk1a trisomy causes
aberrant kinase activity that disrupts neuronal function and consequently impairs cortical circuit function during
juvenile development in DS. The experiments of Aim 1 explore the extent to which Dyrk1a trisomy can account
for impairment in the context of model mice with a larger complement of trisomic genes (Dp1Yey mice; Aim 1a),
and whether postnatal, pharmacologic inhibition of DYRK1A can restore ODP in Ts1Rhr mice (Aim 1b) using
awake optical imaging of intrinsic signals and immediate early gene expression to measure cortical responses
to visual stimulation. Aim 2 focuses on the cellular and molecular bases for circuit impairment in Dyrk1a trisomic
mice. The Cre-Lox recombination system will be used to assess whether Dyrk1a trisomy is required in excitatory
or in inhibitory neurons to impair ODP in Ts1Rhr mice (Aim 2a). The cellular and physiologic effects of Dyrk1a
trisomy will be assessed through patch clamp electrophysiologic analysis of L4 principal neurons, the primary
cortical neurons that receive input from both eyes (Aim 2b). To identify DYRK1A effectors, laser capture micros-
copy will be coupled with mass spectrometry to perform phosphoproteomic analysis of visual cortical layer 4 in
Ts1Rhr mice with 2 or with 3 copies of Dyrk1A in the presence or absence of a challenge of loss of vision in one
eye (Aim 2c). The proposed experiments will address fundamental questions and open new avenues of inquiry
critical to the design and implementation of therapies to ameliorate developmental delay and intellectual disability
in people with DS.",Establishing the role of Dual-Specificity Tyrosine Phosphorylation-Regulated Kinase 1A trisomy in juvenile plasticity impairment in Down Syndrome,"Project Narrative
The proposed research is relevant to public health because this work will provide a new perspective on the
molecular pathogenesis of Down syndrome (DS), the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, which
will enable the identification of new drug targets and provide an approach to test candidate therapies to prevent
developmental delay and cognitive impairment in individuals with DS. The proposed research is relevant to the
NIH’s mission “to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the applica-
tion of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.” This work will also
help to achieve goals of the NIH INvestigation of Co-occurring conditions across the Lifespan to Understand
Down syndrome (INCLUDE) Project to “improve understanding of the biology of Down syndrome and support
development of new treatments for health conditions experienced by individuals with Down syndrome.”",https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10879950,Adolescent;Age;Alleles;Behavior;Biological Assay;Biology;Blindness;Brain;Cells;Complement;Coupled;Cre lox recombination system;Data;Defect;Development;Developmental Delay Disorders;Down&apos;s Syndrome;Drug Targeting;Electrophysiology (science);Eye;Fluorescence;Functional disorder;Gene Expression;Genes;Genetic;Goals;Head;Health;Hippocampus;Immediate-Early Genes;Impaired cognition;Impairment;In Vitro;Individual;Intellectual functioning disability;Investigation;Knowledge;Label;Lasers;Life;Longevity;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Measures;Mediating;Microscopy;Mission;Modeling;Molecular;Morphology;Mus;Nature;Neurons;Ocular Dominance;Organism;Pathogenesis;Persons;Phenotype;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Photic Stimulation;Physiological;Physiology;Play;Process;Proteins;Public Health;Research;Role;Sampling;Signal Transduction;Slice;Specificity;Study models;Testing;Trisomy;Tyrosine Phosphorylation;United States National Institutes of Health;Visual Cortex;Visual System;Work;awake;base;behavioral phenotyping;biocytin;brain circuitry;cognitive function;critical period;design;disability;excitatory neuron;experience;experimental study;improved;inhibitor;inhibitory neuron;laser capture microdissection;monocular deprivation;mouse Ts1Rhr;mouse Ts65Dn;mouse model;neural circuit;new therapeutic target;novel;optical imaging;patch clamp;pharmacologic;phosphoproteomics;postnatal;prevent;response;restoration,10879950,1R21NS137191-01,down syndrome,20,0.93,0.95,tru,,"an understanding of the genetic and molecular bases for developmental delay in down syndrome (ds) will be
