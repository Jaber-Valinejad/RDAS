# Disease Standards and Notations

This document lists the disease-related standards and databases, including their descriptions and links to their official websites.

## What is it?
The primary goal is to standardize disease information across different databases and sources, creating a consistent and comprehensive mapping of rare diseases to enable more accurate research, diagnosis, and treatment options. This data integration process is essential for understanding the clinical manifestations, genetic underpinnings, and phenotypic traits of rare diseases. Additionally, it lays the groundwork for enhancing disease-related data interoperability across various platforms.

##  Conceptual Relationships:

- **Disease Classification Systems** (e.g., **ICD-10**, **ICD-11**, **SNOMED CT**, **MONDO**, **Orphanet**) are used to standardize the categorization of diseases, which helps in organizing large disease datasets.

- **Genetic Databases** (e.g., **OMIM**, **GARD**, **HGNC**, **KEGG**) provide detailed genetic information associated with diseases, often used for identifying genetic markers or potential therapies.

- **Phenotype and Clinical Data** (e.g., **DOID**, **MPATH**, **CSP**) link diseases to clinical presentations or phenotypes, which are important for understanding the manifestation of diseases in patients.
